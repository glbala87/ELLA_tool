# Testing

## Types of tests

### End-to-end
A complete app with frontend and backend is started. Several use-cases are executed through the
 browser simulating a user clicking and entering text. The tests are written in Javascript and
 executed using [webdriverIO] (http://webdriver.io/).

### Unit tests
Testing of isolated Javascript or Python functions.

### API and integration tests
A database instance and the Python backend are started. Tests written in Python use the API and/or
 database to test various scenarios.

The tests are run twice, once against current database schema and once again where the database
 schema has been migrated from baseline to current.


## Running whole test suites

Remember to run `make test-build` before executing tests everytime you make changes.

- `make test` will run most test types apart from e2e.
- `make test-{type}` will run the different types of test.


## During development


### Python

If you want to run a specific API test while developing, enter your development container in VSCode, and select the `Test`-section in the left sidebar. From there you can run and debug specific tests.

Alternatively, you can use `py.test <path>` like normal in the integrated terminal.

The database fixtures are setup in different `conftest.py` files.


### Javascript

You can run `yarn test-watch` inside the container to watch for changes.


### End to end testing (e2e)
We use webdriver.io for testing. See <http://webdriver.io>.

In CI tests are run with `make e2e-test`. This will run Chrome inside the container and run the test suites.
You can run this locally to check that the tests are passing, but it's unsuitable for authoring/editing tests.

To explore the e2e test data, start a local ELLA instance and import the e2e test data: `make dbreset TESTSET=e2e`


#### Local e2e
The following must be installed:
- Chrome
- Chromedriver

The ELLA app and the test execution (wdio) can be either run locally on your host machine or inside Docker: 

1. Start chromedriver on your host machine: 
    ``` bash
    ./chromedriver  --port=4444 --whitelisted-ips= --url-base ''
    ```
2. Start the tests: 
    ``` bash
    make e2e-test-local [options]
    ```

This will connect to the locally running Chromedriver and run one or several test specs. You'll see a local chrome browser where a "ghost" will click and enter text.

You can put debug statements (`browser.debug()`) in your test spec to have the test execution stop and enter a REPL to interact with the browser. You can also open the dev tools in Chrome to dig around. Exit the REPL to have the test continue.

Relevant [`options`] for the `make` command:
Option|Explanation
:--|:--
`DEBUG=true` | Will make the browser visible (as opposed to headless), and increase test timeouts
`CHROME_HOST` | The IP address where the chromedriver is running. This will start a Chrome browser.
`SPEC="\<path to test>"` | Add this to run only a single/few tests. They must given as `src/webui/tests/e2e/tests/..` (comma separated if multiple).
`APP_URL` | URL of the app to test, e.g `http://localhost:8001`. Make sure to use an ip/port that is accessible from within the container where the tests themselves are running. If not defined, the app running inside container of the test execution is used.

::: warning NOTE
Maximize the Chrome window to reduce the number of 'element-not-clickable' errors.

##### Misc

To get and test selectors in Chrome, use an extension, or search (`Ctrl+F`) in the Developer Tools.

You can connect a debugger to Node.js instance on port `5859` to play around.

Use `browser.debug()` in a test file to pause the execution of the tests. This will present a REPL (webdriverio >= 4.5.0) where can you interact with webdriverio client to try out various commands, like `browser.element(...)`. It's also useful to head over to the browser's console to experiment and inspect variables.

Hit `Ctrl-C` in the REPL to continue the test run. See more on <https://webdriver.io/docs/repl/>.
