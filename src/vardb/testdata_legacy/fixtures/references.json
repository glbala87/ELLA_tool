Although no germ-line BRCA1 mutation was observed, 6 of the 18 male breast cancer cases (33%) carried truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene. Unexpectedly, none of them reported a family history for breast/ovarian cancer. Four of six truncating mutations were novel, and two mutations were recurrent. Four patients (22%) had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer in at least one first- or second-degree relative; however, no BRCA2 mutation was identified among them. No mutation was identified in either of the genes in the gynecomastias. These results provide evidence for a strong genetic component of male breast cancer in Hungary."}

The FMF gene (MEFV) was cloned recently, and four missense mutations were identified. Here we present data from non-Ashkenazi Jewish and Arab patients in whom we had not originally found mutations and from a new, more ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted for 79% of carrier chromosomes. Of the two mutations that are novel, one alters the same residue (680) as a previously known mutation, and the other (P369S) is located in exon 3. Consistent with another recent report, the E148Q mutation was observed in patients of several ethnicities and on multiple microsatellite haplotypes, but haplotype data indicate an ancestral relationships between non-Jewish Italian and Ashkenazi Jewish patients with FMF and other affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, the MEFV carrier frequency was 21%, with E148Q the most common mutation. Several lines of evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially for E148Q, P369S, and K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account for recessive inheritance in an Ashkenazi family previously reported as an unusual case of dominantly inherited FMF. The presence of three frequent MEFV mutations in multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests a heterozygote advantage in this geographic region."}

Its diverse clinical expression may include ectopia lentis, skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation, and premature arteriosclerosis and thrombosis. This variability is likely caused by considerable genetic heterogeneity. We investigated the molecular basis of CBS deficiency in 29 Dutch patients from 21 unrelated pedigrees and studied the possibility of a genotype-phenotype relationship with regard to biochemical and clinical expression and response to homocysteine-lowering treatment. Clinical symptoms and biochemical parameters were recorded at diagnosis and during long-term follow-up. Of 10 different mutations detected in the CBS gene, 833T-->C (I278T) was predominant, present in 23 (55%) of 42 independent alleles. At diagnosis, homozygotes for this mutation (n=12) tended to have higher homocysteine levels than those seen in patients with other genotypes (n=17), but similar clinical manifestations. During follow-up, I278T homozygotes responded more efficiently to homocysteine-lowering treatment. After 378 patient-years of treatment, only 2 vascular events were recorded; without treatment, at least 30 would have been expected (P<.01). This intervention in Dutch patients significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and other sequelae of classical homocystinuria syndrome."}

Renal amyloidosis, prevented by colchicine, is the most severe complication of FMF, a disorder associated with mutations in the MEFV gene. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV-gene analysis, we investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients from 77 unrelated families that were not selected through genetic-linkage analysis. Eight mutations, one of which (R408Q) is new, were found to account for 93% of the 163 independent FMF alleles, with both FMF alleles identified in 89% of the patients. In several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence for pseudodominant transmission and incomplete penetrance of the disease phenotype. The M694V homozygous genotype was found to be associated with a higher prevalence of renal amyloidosis and arthritis, compared with other genotypes (P=.0002 and P=.006, respectively). The demonstration of both the diagnostic and prognostic value of MEFV analysis and particular modes of inheritance should lead to new ways for management of FMF-including genetic counseling and therapeutic decisions in affected families."}

Genetic screening for 31 common CFTR mutations was negative, leading us to search for unknown mutations using single-strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis (SSCP/HA). Two novel mutations were detected. In exon 4, a deletion of 8 bp (451458, deltaGCTTCCTA) causes a frameshift and immediately creates a stop codon. In exon 16, mutation 3041G-->A causes the missense change G970D.

Fourteen of these participants consistently had serum free-carnitine levels below the fifth percentile (28 microM for females and 38 microM for males). The OCTN2 (organic cation transporter) gene was sequenced for these 14 subjects, for 22 subjects whose carnitine levels were below the fifth percentile in the first screening but were normal in the second measurement and in 69 individuals with normal carnitine levels for two separate measurements. Polymorphic sequences defined three major haplotypes with equal frequency. Mutations were identified in nine subjects with low carnitine levels: Trp132X (three individuals), Ser467Cys (four), Trp283Cys (one) and Met179Leu (one). In vitro expression studies in HEK cells indicated that Ser467Cys and Trp283Cys, but not Met179Leu, significantly reduced L-carnitine uptake relative to the normal control. Trp132X and Ser467Cys were associated with specific haplotypes, suggesting a founder effect. A conservative estimate of the overall prevalence of heterozygotes was 1.01% in the Akita prefecture, Japan, giving an estimated incidence of primary systemic carnitine deficiency (MIM 212140) as 1 in 40 000 births. An echocardiographic study of the families of patients with primary carnitine deficiency revealed that the heterozygotes for OCTN2 mutations were predisposed to late onset benign cardiac hypertrophy (odds ratio 15.1, 95% CI 1.39-164) compared with the wild-types.

Stage 1 screening was aimed to analyze patients at highest risk for the most common disease-associated sequence variants listed in the BIC database. Accordingly, stage1 testing implied detection of 18 disease- associated BRCA1 and 9 BRCA2 mutations by adapting the 5' nuclease assay to heterozygote screening. For stage 2 screening, we applied the conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) method by adapting this technique to automated heteroduplex analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using fragment scanning on an ABI 377 sequencing device. Of the 120 patients with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer who took part in this study so far, 45 entered stage 1 testing. Disease-associated mutations were detected in 6 patients by stage 1 testing (13%). For these patients, the final result was available within 10 days. Mutation 300T-->G was found in 2 patients. One patient with mutation 3036delACAA in BRCA2 reported only 1 sister with a multifocal bilateral breast cancer. New disease-associated mutations were detected in 2 of the 114 patients who entered the stage 2 test (1.7%). Of particular interest was 1 patient who was diagnosed with a medullary breast carcinoma at age 39 and who had no family history of breast cancer. We conclude that pre-screening by 5' nuclease assay for the mutations most frequently seen in a given population represents a relatively effective first line of analysis. Subsequent detailed analysis by fluorescence conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis (F-CSGE) and fragment sequencing is a sensitive alternative to full nucleotide sequencing."}

This disorder maps to human chromosome 1q41. Recently, mutations in USHIIa patients were identified in a novel gene isolated from this chromosomal region. The USH2A gene encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 171.5 kD and possesses laminin epidermal growth factor as well as fibronectin type III domains. These domains are observed in other protein components of the basal lamina and extracellular matrixes; they may also be observed in cell-adhesion molecules. The intron/exon organization of the gene whose protein we name \"Usherin\" was determined by direct sequencing of PCR products and cloned genomic DNA with cDNA-specific primers. The gene is encoded by 21 exons and spans a minimum of 105 kb. A mutation search of 57 independent USHIIa probands was performed with a combination of direct sequencing and heteroduplex analysis of PCR-amplified exons. Fifteen new mutations were found. Of 114 independent USH2A alleles, 58 harbored probable pathologic mutations. Ten cases of USHIIa were true homozygotes and 10 were compound heterozygotes; 18 heterozygotes with only one identifiable mutation were observed. Sixty-five percent (38/58) of cases had at least one mutation, and 51% (58/114) of the total number of possible mutations were identified. The allele 2299delG (previously reported as 2314delG) was the most frequent mutant allele observed (16%; 31/192). Three new missense mutations (C319Y, N346H, and C419F) were discovered; all were restricted to the previously unreported laminin domain VI region of Usherin. The possible significance of this domain, known to be necessary for laminin network assembly, is discussed in the context of domain VI mutations from other proteins."}

J.: 348 Pt 3, 621-32.", "abstract": "We have identified and characterized three missense mutations in a patient with type 1 G(M1) gangliosidosis, namely a substitution of G for A at nucleotide position 1044 (G1044-->A; in exon 10) on one allele, which converts Asp(332) into asparagine, and both a mutation (C492-->A in exon 4, leading to the amino acid change of Arg(148)-->Ser) and a polymorphism (A1644-->G in exon 15, leading to a change of Ser(532)-->Gly) on the other allele. This patient had less than 1% residual beta-galactosidase activity and minimally detectable levels of immunoreactive beta-galactosidase protein in fibroblasts. To account for the above findings, a series of expression and immunolocalization studies were undertaken to assess the impact of each mutation. Transient overexpression in COS-1 cells of cDNAs encoding Asp(332)Asn, Arg(148)Ser and Ser(532)Gly mutant beta-galactosidases produced abundant amounts of precursor beta-galactosidase, with activities of 0, 84 and 81% compared with the cDNA clone for wild-type beta-galactosidase (GP8). Since the level of vector-driven expression is much less in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells than in COS-1 cells, and we knew that exogenous beta-galactosidase undergoes lysosomal processing when expressed in these cells, transient expression studies were performed of Arg(148)Ser and Ser(532)Gly, which yielded active forms of the enzyme. In this case, the Arg(148)Ser and Ser(532)Gly products gave rise to 11% and 86% of the control activity respectively. These results were not unexpected, since the Arg(148)Ser mutation introduced a major conformational change into the protein, and we anticipated that it would be degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the polymorphism was expected to produce near-normal activity. To examine the effect of the Asp(332)Asn mutation on the catalytic activity, we isolated CHO clones permanently transfected with the Asp(332)Asn and Asp(332)Glu constructs, purified the enzymes by substrate-analogue-affinity chromatography, and determined their kinetic parameters. The V(max) values of both mutant recombinant enzymes were markedly reduced (less than 0.9% of the control), and the K(m) values were unchanged compared with the corresponding wild-type enzyme isolated at the same time. Both the Arg(148)Ser beta-galactosidase in CHO cells and Asp(332)Asn beta-galactosidases (in COS-1 and CHO cells) produced abundant immunoreaction in the perinuclear area, consistent with localization in the ER. A low amount was detected in lysosomes. Incubation of patient fibroblasts in the presence of leupeptin, which reduces the rate of degradation of lysosomal beta-galactosidase by thiol proteases, had no effect on residual enzyme activity, and immunostaining was again detected largely in the perinuclear area (localized to the ER) with much lower amounts in the lysosomes. In summary, the Arg(148)Ser mutation has no effect on catalytic activity, whereas the Asp(332)Asn mutation seriously reduces catalytic activity, suggesting that Asp(332) might play a role in the active site. Immunofluorescence studies indicate the expressed mutant proteins with Arg(148)Ser and Asp(332)Asn mutations are held up in the ER, where they are probably degraded, resulting in only minimum amounts of the enzyme becoming localized in the lysosomes. These results are completely consistent with findings in the cultured fibroblasts. Our results imply that most of the missense mutations described in G(M1) gangliosidosis to date have little effect on catalytic activity, but do affect protein conformation such that the resulting protein cannot be transported out of the ER and fails to arrive in the lysosome. This accounts for the minimal amounts of enzyme protein and activity seen in most G(M1) gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts."}

Hypothesizing that DCM is a disease of the cytoskeleton and sarcolemma, we have focused on candidate genes whose products are found in these structures. Here we report the screening of the human delta-sarcoglycan gene, a member of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, by single-stranded DNA conformation polymorphism analysis and by DNA sequencing in patients with DCM. Mutations affecting the secondary structure were identified in one family and two sporadic cases, whereas immunofluorescence analysis of myocardium from one of these patients demonstrated significant reduction in delta-sarcoglycan staining. No skeletal muscle disease occurred in any of these patients. These data suggest that delta-sarcoglycan is a disease-causing gene responsible for familial and idiopathic DCM and lend support to our \"final common pathway\" hypothesis that DCM is a cytoskeletalopathy."}

S1235R is not among the commonly reported mutations, and it is not routinely screened for in most laboratories. However, we have detected the S1235R allele at a frequency that is significantly higher than that of many other CF mutations.

Five patients were compound heterozygotes for a second CFTR mutation: two cases (one family) were N1303K/S1235R and three unrelated cases were deltaF508/S1235R. Our data suggest that S1235R, when combined with a second CF mutation, may be pathogenic, although phenotypic manifestations appear to be variable.

The impairment of hGALT causes galactosemia. One missense mutation, an aspartate to asparagine substitution at amino acid 314 (N314D), impairs 50% activity in the homozygous state in some patients but gives near normal activity in others. The former condition is called Duarte (D) and the latter, Los Angeles (LA). The D allele is linked to hGALT polymorphisms including a deletion 5'to the translation start site (-119 to -116delGTCA), g1391G --> A and g1105G --> C. The LA allele is linked to a g1721C --> T transition. To investigate possible mechanisms for differences in hGALT activity between the D and LA alleles, we sequenced 3951 nucleotides of genomic DNA 5' to the hGALT translation start site. Using a dual-luciferase reporter system to express deletion constructs of the hGALT promoter, we noted both positive and negative regulatory regions. Two putative positive regulatory domains overlap with the naturally occurring -119 to -116delGTCA linked to Duarte. One is an E-box motif (CACGTG) at -117 to -112 bp. The second is an AP-1 motif (TCAGTCAG) at -124 to -119 bp. The delGTCA mutation confers reduced luciferase activity to transfected cell lines derived from human ovarian and liver neoplasms. Additionally, human lymphoblasts derived from patients with the Duarte allele have reduced GALT mRNA.

None of the individuals exhibited the Sicilian mutations, Y250X in exon 6, M172K in exon 4, and E60X in exon 2. One iron-overloaded individual of Asian descent exhibited a I238M mutation which was subsequently found to be a polymorphism present in the Asian population at a frequency of 0.0192. The presence of the I238M mutation was not associated with an increase in ferritin or transferrin saturation levels. Three silent polymorphisms were also identified, nt 1770 (D590D) and nt 1851 (A617A) and a polymorphism at nt 2255 in the 3' UTR. Thus, mutations in the transferrin receptor-2 gene were not responsible for the iron overload seen in our subjects."}

Observed and expected cancer incidence in first degree relatives of the patients was estimated using data from the Danish Cancer Registry.\nTwenty four mutation carriers were identified (20%), of whom 13 had a BRCA1 mutation and 11 carried a BRCA2 mutation. Two mutations in BRCA1 were found repeatedly in the material and accounted for seven of the 24 (29%) mutation carriers. The mutation frequency was about equal in patients with bilateral (22%) and multifocal breast cancer (18%). The incidence of breast and ovarian cancer was greatly increased in first degree relatives of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, but to a much lesser degree in relatives of non-carriers. An increased risk of cancer was also noted in brothers of non-carriers.\nA relatively broad spectrum of germline mutations was observed in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and most of the mutations are present in other populations. Our results indicate that a diagnosis of bilateral and multifocal breast cancer is predictive of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status, particularly when combined with information on the patients' age at diagnosis and family history of breast/ovarian cancer."}

Of these patients, 117 had also been previously evaluated and were found not to carry mutations in the RDS gene. The single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method was used to search for sequence variants, which were then directly sequenced. The relatives of selected patients were recruited for segregation analyses. Clinical evaluations of patients included a measurement of Snellen visual acuity, final dark adaptation thresholds, visual fields, and ERGs. Clinical data were compared with those obtained earlier from a study of 128 patients with dominant rhodopsin mutations.\nOf the 241 patients, all were screened for the most common RP1 mutation (Arg677Ter), and 10 patients were found to have this mutation. In addition, an evaluation of a subset of 189 patients in whom the entire coding sequence was evaluated revealed the following mutations: Gln679Ter (1 case), Gly723Ter (2 cases), Glu729(1-bp del) (1 case), Leu762(5-bp del) (2 cases), and Asn763(4-bp del) (1 case). All of these mutations cosegregated with RP in the families of the index patients. Nine missense mutations that were each found in six or fewer patients were encountered. The segregation of eight of these was evaluated in the respective patients' families, and only one segregated with dominant RP. This cosegregating missense change was in cis with the nonsense mutation Gln679Ter. Although patients with RP1 mutations had, on average, slightly better visual acuity than patients with rhodopsin mutations, there was no statistically significant difference in final dark-adaptation thresholds, visual field diameters, or cone electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes. Comparably aged patients with RP1 mutations had visual function that varied by approximately two orders of magnitude, based on visual fields and ERG amplitudes.\nDominant RP1 alleles typically have premature nonsense codons occurring in the last exon of the gene and would be expected to encode mutant proteins that are only approximately one third the size of the wild-type protein, suggesting that a dominant negative effect rather than haploinsufficiency is the mechanism leading to RP caused by RP1 mutations. On average, patients with RP1 mutations have slightly better visual acuity than patients with dominant rhodopsin mutations; otherwise, they have similarly severe disease. The wide range in severity among patients with RP1 mutations indicates that other genetic or environmental factors modulate the effect of the primary mutation."}

The G160D substitution, and a fourth defect affecting the highly conserved CVC domain (P247R), occurred in a child with very severe PPD who required a corneal transplant at 3 months of age. In this family, relatives with the G160D change alone had mild to moderate PPD, while P247R alone caused no corneal abnormalities.

A family-based linkage and association test indicated that these mutations co-segregate with prostate cancer (P = 0.0007). In addition, among men of European descent, MSR1 mutations were detected in 4.4% of individuals affected with non-HPC as compared with 0.8% of unaffected men (P = 0.009).

We screened family members for NPHS2 mutations. NPHS2 mutations appeared to be responsible for disease in nine of these families. In six families, the affected individuals were compound heterozygotes for a nonconservative R229Q amino acid substitution. This R229Q variant has an allele frequency of 3.6% in a control population. In these families, R229Q was the only mutation identified on one of the two disease-associated NPHS2 alleles. We used in vitro-translated podocin and purified nephrin to investigate the effect of R229Q on their interaction and found decreased nephrin binding to the R229Q podocin. These data suggest that this common polymorphism contributes to the development of FSGS. Chromosomes bearing the R229Q mutation share a common haplotype defining an approximately 0.2-Mb region. R229Q appears to enhance susceptibility to FSGS in association with a second mutant NPHS2 allele. Identification of R229Q mutations may be of clinical importance, as NPHS2-associated disease appears to define a subgroup of FSGS patients unresponsive to corticosteroids."}

The authors hypothesized that the progression of breast neoplasia may differ between patients with hereditary disease and patients with nonhereditary disease and that this difference in progression may be visualized by studying the prevalence of precursor lesions and neoplastic lesions.\nThe authors developed two case cohorts of high-risk patients with a strong family history of breast carcinoma who underwent prophylactic mastectomy. The first cohort was comprised of women who underwent therapeutic mastectomy and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, and the second cohort was comprised of women who underwent bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Patients without a family history of breast carcinoma who underwent unilateral or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy were selected as a control group. DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes was screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations. The available pathologic materials were reviewed independently by two pathologists, and all neoplastic and precursor lesions were identified and classified. Proliferation activity was assessed using MIB-1 immunohistochemistry on all available lesions from the unilateral mastectomy cohort.\nThe 28 women from the unilateral cohort with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations had a lower prevalence of proliferative fibrocystic changes (PFC) (7%) compared with their matched control group (25%) (P = 0.075) and with patients who had a family history but no BRCA1/2 mutation (22-33%). None of the 11 deleterious mutation carriers from the bilateral cohort (0%) had PFC compared with 36% of women in the matched control group (P = 0.03). There was no major difference in the prevalence of other precursor lesions (including in situ carcinoma) in either cohort. Invasive carcinomas from the deleterious mutation carriers in the unilateral cohort were of higher grade compared with the control group (P = 0.003) and patients without a mutation (P < 0.0001) but were of similar grade compared with carriers of unclassified variant BRCA1/2 alterations (P = 0.20). Neoplastic lesions from the deleterious mutation carriers in the unilateral cohort had higher MIB-1 proliferation indices compared with other patients with and without a family history of breast carcinoma.\nThe current data suggest that the progression rate of breast neoplasia is accelerated in women who carry BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations compared with other patients who have breast carcinoma with or without a family history. This increased progression rate should be taken into account when considering the surveillance of asymptomatic women."}

The longest continuous open reading frame (ORF) is encoded by a 67-exon transcript and predicted to yield a 4074-amino acid protein (\"polyductin\") of thus far unknown function. By now, a total of 29 different PKHD1 mutations have been described. This study reports mutation screening in 90 ARPKD patients and identifies mutations in 110 alleles making up a detection rate of 61%. Thirty-four of the detected mutations have not been reported previously. Two underlying mutations in 40 patients and one mutation in 30 cases are disclosed, and no mutation was detected on the remaining chromosomes. Mutations were found to be scattered throughout the gene without evidence of clustering at specific sites. About 45% of the changes were predicted to truncate the protein. All missense mutations were nonconservative, with the affected amino acid residues found to be conserved in the murine polyductin orthologue. One recurrent missense mutation (T36M) likely represents a mutational hotspot and occurs in a variety of populations. Two founder mutations (R496X and V3471G) make up about 60% of PKHD1 mutations in the Finnish population. Preliminary genotype-phenotype correlations could be established for the type of mutation rather than for the site of the individual mutation. All patients carrying two truncating mutations displayed a severe phenotype with perinatal or neonatal demise. PKHD1 mutation analysis is a powerful tool to establish the molecular cause of ARPKD in a given family. Direct identification of mutations allows an unequivocal diagnosis and accurate genetic counseling even in families displaying diagnostic challenges."}

Mutations occur throughout the entire coding region of the gene, and there is considerable ethnic and geographical diversity in the deleterious mutations detected in different populations. No data exist on the role of the BRCA2 gene in the Cypriot population. In this study we present the results of characterizing mutations in the BRCA2 gene, in 26 Cypriot families with multiple cases of breast/ovarian cancer. The entire coding region, including splice sites, of BRCA2 were sequenced using cycle sequencing. In total 29 BRCA2 variants were detected which include 3 truncating mutations, 8 missense mutations, 6 polymorphisms and 12 intronic variants. The 3 truncating mutations are frameshift mutation 8984delG (exon 22), and two nonsense mutations, namely C1913X (exon 11) which is a novel mutation, and K3326X (exon 27). It is of interest that frameshift mutation 8984delG was the most frequent, since it was detected in 5 patients from three different families. Among the 6 polymorphisms detected, polymorphism T77T is novel and similarly 4 of the 12 intronic variants were also novel, namely IVS1+8G>A, IVS1-96insA, IVS4+36A>G and IVS11-51G>T. These results show that deleterious BRCA2 mutations, occur at the same frequency, about 20%, in Cypriot families, as that recorded in other European populations. We conclude that the BRCA2 gene plays a significant role in the familial breast cancer phenotype in the Cypriot population."}

Statistically significant differences were achieved for six (178G/A, 552C/T, 561C/T, 702C/T, IVS3-6C/T and 831G/A) of these variants. The T-allele of the 561C/T polymorphism was over represented in the HSCR/Down's syndrome patient group (36% representing 5 of 14) compared to normal controls (6% representing 5 of 84) (p < 0.002, chi(2) with Yates correction = 12.14), suggesting that the 561C/T variant is associated with a low penetrance effect in patients with this complex phenotype. Detection of the 178G/A polymorphism in only non-syndromic HSCR patients, provide further support for an important role of specific sequence variants in the EDNRB gene in the HSCR/Down's syndrome phenotype."}

Sequencing analysis and familial restriction studies revealed that the maternal allele of this patient carried the L436F polymorphism in cis with the known R201C mutation. The new mutation R68W was identified in his paternal allele. Since the GLB1 activity of the patient's leukocytes was very low and compatible with both the type-I and the type-II form of the disease, the potential impact of each mutation was investigated by expression studies in COS1 cells, and Western blots. Expression study of the R68W mutated allele resulted in no GLB1 activity. Transfection with a vector carrying the R201C mutation gave rise to a residual GLB1 activity, which, interestingly, was severely reduced in transfection with the L436F/R201C allele. These expression studies, together with co-transfection experiments, suggest that the R201C/L436F GLB1 \"complex allele\" leads to this patient's clinical and biochemical findings. The type-II phenotype of the disease is subdivided into late infantile and juvenile forms. The clinical and molecular characterization of this patient as late-infantile GM1 gangliosidosis is in keeping with a clear-cut division between the two sub forms of the type-II phenotype. The modulating role of the L436F polymorphism should be stressed as a cause of this patient's condition. This model suggests that the combination of missense mutations or polymorphisms should be evaluated when diagnosing inherited genetic disorders."}

Mutat.: 21(4), 408-23.", "abstract": "The proximal promoter region of the human pituitary expressed growth hormone (GH1) gene is highly polymorphic, containing at least 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This variation is manifest in 40 different haplotypes, the high diversity being explicable in terms of gene conversion, recurrent mutation, and selection. Functional analysis showed that 12 haplotypes were associated with a significantly reduced level of reporter gene expression whereas 10 haplotypes were associated with a significantly increased level. The former tend to be more prevalent in the general population than the latter (p<0.01), possibly as a consequence of selection. Although individual SNPs contributed to promoter strength in a highly interactive and non-additive fashion, haplotype partitioning was successful in identifying six SNPs as major determinants of GH1 gene expression. The prediction and functional testing of hitherto unobserved super-maximal and sub-minimal promoter haplotypes was then used to test the efficacy of the haplotype partitioning approach. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that five SNP sites exhibit allele-specific protein binding. An association was noted between adult height and the mean in vitro expression value corresponding to an individual's GH1 promoter haplotype combination (p=0.028) although only 3.3% of the variance of adult height was found to be explicable by reference to this parameter. Three additional SNPs, identified within sites I and II of the upstream locus control region (LCR), were ascribed to three distinct LCR haplotypes. A series of LCR-GH1 proximal promoter constructs were used to demonstrate that 1) the LCR enhanced proximal promoter activity by up to 2.8-fold depending upon proximal promoter haplotype, and that 2) the activity of a given proximal promoter haplotype was also differentially enhanced by different LCR haplotypes. The genetic basis of inter-individual differences in GH1 gene expression thus appears to be extremely complex."}

In this study, we report a novel lysozyme variant, Phe57Ile, associated with renal amyloidosis in three patients in one Italian Canadian family.\nThe proband was a 52-year-old woman who developed renal failure at the age of 42 years. Renal biopsy demonstrated replacement of glomeruli by amyloid. Her younger sister and her younger daughter who underwent renal transplantation also had renal amyloidosis. The proband's older daughter and her niece were in good health. To elucidate pathogenesis of this hereditary renal amyloidosis, DNA analyses of the lysozyme gene, including single strand confirmation polymorphism, direct DNA sequence, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses, were performed.\nDNA analyses of the lysozyme gene revealed a T to A transversion at the first position of codon 57 of the lysozyme gene in the proband, her sister, and her affected and unaffected daughters, indicating a replacement of Phe by Ile at residue 57. In addition, DNA sequencing demonstrated a C to A transversion at the second position of codon 70, denoting a replacement of Thr by Asn at residue 70, in the proband's sister and her niece. Thus, the proband's sister is compound heterozygous for the Phe57Ile and Thr70Asn alleles.\nDistinctive clinical features in patients of this family are nephropathy due to renal amyloidosis. Our results indicate that the novel lysozyme variant Phe57Ile is associated with renal amyloidosis in this family. From our results, a clear relation between the Thr70Asn polymorphism and renal amyloidosis could not be demonstrated."}

This variant is less stable than the wild-type protein by 3.7 kcal/mol, but more stable than the pathological, amyloidogenic variants. Unfolding kinetics in guanidine are six times faster than in the wild-type, but three and twenty times slower than in the amyloidogenic variants. Enzyme catalytic parameters, such as maximal velocity and affinity, are reduced in comparison to the wild-type. The solution structure, determined by 1H NMR and modeling calculations, exhibits a more compact arrangement at the interface between the beta-sheet domain and the subsequent loop on one side and part of the alpha domain on the other side, compared with the wild-type protein. This is the opposite of the conformational variation shown by the amyloidogenic variant D67H, but it accounts for the reduced stability and catalytic performance of T70N."}

Forty-seven ARPKD and 14 pedigrees with congenital hepatic fibrosis and/or Caroli's disease, were screened for PKHD1 mutations.\nThirty-three different mutations were detected on 57 alleles (51.1% ARPKD, 32.1% congenital hepatic fibrosis/Caroli's disease). In the 22 pedigrees where both mutations were identified, two were homozygous for 9689delA and the remainder were compound heterozygotes; a combination of truncating, missense and splicing changes. Patients with two truncating mutations all died in the perinatal period. Two frequent truncating mutations were identified: 9689delA (9 alleles) and 5896insA (8 alleles) plus some more common missense changes; haplotype analysis indicated most were ancestral mutations.\nDHPLC has been established as a rapid mutation screening method for ARPKD. The mutation detection rate was high in severely affected patients (85%), lower in those with moderate ARPKD (41.9%), and low, but significant, in adults with congenital hepatic fibrosis/Caroli's disease (32.1%). The prospects for gene-based diagnostics are complicated by the large gene size, marked allelic heterogeneity, and clinical diversity of the ARPKD phenotype.

We identified 60 mutations in BRCA1 and 53 in BRCA2. Of the 53 distinct mutations observed, 11 are novel and 12 have been reported only in Spanish families (41.5%).

We studied 2 unrelated patients with fXI levels less than 20% of normal and family histories indicating dominant disease transmission. Both are heterozygous for single amino acid substitutions in the fXI catalytic domain (Gly400Val and Trp569Ser). Neither mutant is secreted by transfected fibroblasts. In cotransfection experiments with a wild-type fXI construct, constructs with mutations common in Ashkenazi Jews (Glu117Stop and Phe283Leu) and a variant with a severe defect in dimer formation (fXI-Gly350Glu) have little effect on wild-type fXI secretion. In contrast, cotransfection with fXI-Gly400Val or fXI-Trp569Ser reduces wild-type secretion about 50%, consistent with a dominant negative effect. Immunoprecipitation of cell lysates confirmed that fXI-Gly400Val forms intracellular dimers. The data support a model in which nonsecretable mutant fXI polypeptides trap wild-type polypeptides within cells through heterodimer formation, resulting in lower plasma fXI levels than in heterozygotes for mutations that cause autosomal recessive fXI deficiency."}

Mutat.: 23(5), 487-95.", "abstract": "Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is one of the most common hereditary renal cystic diseases in children. The clinical spectrum ranges from stillbirth and neonatal demise to survival into adulthood. In a given family, however, patients usually display comparable phenotypes. Many families who lost a child with severe ARPKD desire an early and reliable prenatal diagnosis (PD). Given the limitations of antenatal ultrasound, this is only feasible by molecular genetics that became possible in 1994 when PKHD1, the locus for ARPKD, was mapped to chromosome 6p. However, linkage analysis might prove difficult or even impossible in families with diagnostic doubts or in whom no DNA of an affected child is available. In such cases the recent identification of the PKHD1 gene provides the basis for direct mutation testing. However, due to the large size of the gene, lack of knowledge of the encoded protein's functional properties, and the complicated pattern of splicing, significant challenges are posed by PKHD1 mutation analysis. Thus, it is important to delineate the mutational spectrum and the reachable mutation detection rate among the cohort of severely affected ARPKD patients. In the present study, we performed PKHD1 mutation screening by DHPLC in a series of 40 apparently unrelated families with at least one peri- or neonatally deceased child. We observed 68 out of an expected 80 mutations, corresponding to a detection rate of 85%. Among the mutations identified, 23 were not reported previously. We disclosed two underlying mutations in 29 families and one in 10 cases. Thus, in all but one family (98 percent;), we were able to identify at least one mutation substantiating the diagnosis of ARPKD. Approximately two-thirds of the changes were predicted to truncate the protein. Missense mutations detected were nonconservative, with all but one of the affected amino acid residues found to be conserved in the murine ortholog. PKHD1 mutation analysis has proven to be an efficient and effective means to establish the diagnosis of ARPKD."}

Individuals negative for the type II and type III mutations were screened by a combination of SSCP and heteroduplex analysis. The C128X mutation was found in 10 families (one previously described). Among three individuals with severe FXI deficiency, one was homozygous for the C128X mutation, and two were compound heterozygotes for the C128X and another mutation; other individuals were carriers of the C128X mutation. This is a nonsense mutation producing a truncated protein; individuals have FXI antigen levels concordant with FXI coagulant activity. Haplotype analysis of 11 families, including a further kindred previously reported from the USA, but which originally came from the UK (in which the index patient was homozygous for C128X), suggests a founder effect."}

It is not known, however, to what extent these 3 founder mutations account for all of the BRCA mutations distributed throughout the country. This question has important implications for health policy and the design of epidemiologic studies. To establish the relative contributions of founder and nonfounder BRCA mutations, we established the entire spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in a large set of breast-ovarian cancer families with origins in all regions of Poland. We sequenced the entire coding regions of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 100 Polish families with 3 or more cases of breast cancer and in 100 families with cases of both breast and ovarian cancer. A mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was detected in 66% of breast cancer families and in 63% of breast-ovarian cancer families. Of 129 mutations, 122 (94.6%) were in BRCA1 and 7 (5.4%) were in BRCA2. Of the 122 families with BRCA1 mutations, 119 (97.5%) had a recurrent mutation (i.e., one that was seen in at least 2 families). In particular, 111 families (91.0%) carried one of the 3 common founder mutations. The mutation spectrum was not different between families with and without ovarian cancer. These findings suggest that a rapid and inexpensive assay directed at identifying the 3 common founder mutations will have a sensitivity of 86% compared to a much more costly and labor-intensive full-sequence analysis of both genes. This rapid test will facilitate large-scale national epidemiologic and clinical studies of hereditary breast cancer, potentially including studies of chemoprevention."}

In addition, a pair of rare variants, Q356R and S1512I, was detected in BRCA1 in patients belonging to two Cypriot families. The simultaneous presence of this pair of missense mutations may be associated with the breast cancer phenotype in the Cypriot population.

Interpretation of truncating mutations, gene rearrangements, and obvious splice junction mutations, is generally straightforward. However, classification of missense variants often presents a difficult problem. From a series of 20,000 full sequence tests of BRCA1 carried out at Myriad Genetic Laboratories, a total of 314 different missense changes and eight in-frame deletions were observed. Before this study, only 21 of these missense changes were classified as deleterious or suspected deleterious and 14 as neutral or of little clinical significance.\nWe have used a combination of a multiple sequence alignment of orthologous BRCA1 sequences and a measure of the chemical difference between the amino acids present at individual residues in the sequence alignment to classify missense variants and in-frame deletions detected during mutation screening of BRCA1.\nIn the present analysis we were able to classify an additional 50 missense variants and two in-frame deletions as probably deleterious and 92 missense variants as probably neutral. Thus we have tentatively classified about 50% of the unclassified missense variants observed during clinical testing of BRCA1.\nAn internal test of the analysis is consistent with our classification of the variants designated probably deleterious; however, we must stress that this classification is tentative and does not have sufficient independent confirmation to serve as a clinically applicable stand alone method."}

We uncovered four different homozygous substitutions in ARL6 in four unrelated families affected with Bardet-Biedl syndrome, two of which disrupt a threonine residue important for GTP binding and function of several related small GTP-binding proteins. Analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans ARL6 homolog indicates that it is specifically expressed in ciliated cells, and that, in addition to the postulated cytoplasmic functions of ARL proteins, it undergoes intraflagellar transport. These findings implicate a small GTP-binding protein in ciliary transport and the pathogenesis of a pleiotropic disorder."}

Positive correlations could further be demonstrated between renal and hepatobiliary-related morbidity suggesting uniform disease progression rather than organ-specific patterns. PKHD1 mutation analysis revealed 193 mutations (70 novel ones; 77% nonconservative missense mutations). No patient carried two truncating mutations corroborating that one missense mutation is indispensable for survival of newborns. We attempted to set up genotype-phenotype correlations and to categorize missense mutations.

This screen consisted of 170 PXE chromosomes in 81 families, and detected 59 distinct mutations (32 missense, eight nonsense, and six likely splice-site point mutations; one small insertion; and seven small and five large deletions). Forty-three of these mutations are novel variants, which increases the total number of PXE mutations to 121. While most mutations are rare, three nonsense mutations, a splice donor site mutation, and the large deletion comprising exons 23-29 (c.2996_4208del) were identified as relatively frequent PXE mutations at 26%, 5%, 3.5%, 3%, and 11%, respectively. Chromosomal haplotyping with two proximal and two distal polymorphic markers flanking ABCC6 demonstrated that most chromosomes that carry these relatively frequent PXE mutations have related haplotypes specific for these mutations, which suggests that these chromosomes originate from single founder mutations. The types of mutations found support loss-of-function as the molecular mechanism for the PXE phenotype. In 76 of the 81 families, the affected individuals were either homozygous for the same mutation or compound heterozygous for two mutations. In the remaining five families with one uncovered mutation, affected showed allelic compound heterozygosity for the cosegregating PXE haplotype. This demonstrates pseudo-dominance as the relevant inheritance mechanism, since disease transmission to the next generation always requires one mutant allelic variant from each parent. In contrast to other previous clinical and molecular claims, our results show evidence only for recessive PXE. This has profound consequences for the genetic counseling of families with PXE."}

Its study and a comparison of its properties with those of the amyloidogenic variants of lysozyme is therefore important for understanding the determinants of amyloid disease. We report here the X-ray crystal structure and the solution dynamics of T70N lysozyme, as monitored by hydrogen/deuterium exchange and NMR relaxation experiments. The X-ray crystal structure shows that a substantial structural rearrangement results from the amino acid substitution, involving residues 45-51 and 68-75 in particular, and gives rise to a concomitant separation of these two loops of up to 6.5A. A marked decrease in the magnitudes of the generalised order parameter (S2) values of the amide nitrogen atom, for residues 70-74, shows that the T70N substitution increases the flexibility of the peptide backbone around the site of mutation. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange protection factors measured by NMR spectroscopy were calculated for the T70N variant and the wild-type protein. The protection factors for many of backbone amide groups in the beta-domain of the T70N variant are decreased relative to those in the wild-type protein, whereas those in the alpha-domain display wild-type-like values. In pulse-labelled hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments monitored by mass spectrometry, transient but locally cooperative unfolding of the beta-domain of the T70N variant and the wild-type protein was observed, but at higher temperatures than for the amyloidogenic variants I56T and D67H. These findings reveal that such partial unfolding is an intrinsic property of the human lysozyme structure, and suggest that the readiness with which it occurs is a critical feature determining whether or not amyloid deposition occurs in vivo."}

ARPKD is caused by mutations in the polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene, which consists of 86 exons that are variably assembled into a number of alternatively spliced transcripts. The longest transcript, comprising 67 exons, encodes the protein fibrocystin/polyductin. We have set up mutation analysis by direct sequencing of these 67 exons. In 39 mainly Dutch families we identified: 11 nonsense mutations, 15 deletions/insertions, 5 splice site mutations, and 39 missense mutations. To classify missense variants we combined evolutionary conservation, using the human, chimpanzee, dog, mouse, chicken and frog Pkhd1 sequences, with the Grantham score for chemical differences. Thirty-three missense mutations were considered pathogenic and seven were classified as rare, probably pathogenic variants. In addition to sequence analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was used to identify multiple exon deletions. However, no large deletions in the PKHD1 gene were identified. In 31 index patients two mutations were found, in 6 patients one mutation was found, leading to a mutation detection rate of 87%. The analysis of amino acid conservation as well as applying the Grantham score for chemical differences allowed us to determine the pathogeneity for nearly all new missense mutations and thus proved to be useful tools to classify missense variants."}

This type of hereditary ALys amyloidosis is characterized by extended amyloid deposits in the upper gastrointestinal tract, entire colon, and kidney, leading to gastrointestinal bleeding. Both mutations are probably effective in disease manifestation. The novel mutation at position 112 in the mature protein is located within the alpha-helical domain of the protein and therefore outside the cluster of residues that has so far been implicated in ALys amyloidosis. Taken together with the p.T70N mutation, this results in a lysozyme species where the correct folding of various protein domains is probably impaired and increases the propensity of amyloid fibril formation. Interestingly, this form of ALys amyloidosis is also characterized by the occurrence of proteolytic fragments of lysozyme in the amyloid deposits."}

FAP is caused by mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumour suppressor gene that has a high penetrance. The disease is characterized by the occurrence of hundreds to thousands of colorectal polyps, which if left untreated give rise to colorectal cancer. In Cyprus, there are no molecular data available as yet on families with FAP. This work presents the results of APC analysis in our population for the first time. The APC gene was analyzed in 33 DNA samples from 20 individuals belonging to four FAP families and 13 patients with sporadic polyposis. We identified three truncating mutations, four missense mutations and 11 polymorphisms. It is of interest that two of the three truncating mutations, 2307delA and Q1242X, are novel, which supports the existence of a unique genetic pool in the Cypriot population. This ethnic molecular study in addition to highlighting population heterogeneity also contributes to phenotype-genotype associations that are essential for the clinical management of FAP families in Cyprus."}

In view of the complexity of the genes involved, and to minimise sequencing, a protocol for efficient testing of samples was developed. This includes a preliminary linkage and haplotype analysis to indicate which genes to target. It proved very useful and demonstrated consanguinity in several unsuspected cases. In contrast to CDH23 and PCDH15, where most of the changes are truncating mutations, myosin VIIA has both nonsense and missense mutations. Methods for deciding whether a missense mutation is pathogenic are discussed.\nDiagnostic testing for USH1 is feasible with a high rate of detection and can be made more efficient by selecting a candidate gene by preliminary linkage and haplotype analysis."}

Mutat.: 27(7), 654-66.", "abstract": "Rapid and reliable identification of deleterious changes in the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become one of the major issues in most DNA services laboratories. To rapidly detect all possible changes within the coding and splice site determining sequences of the breast cancer genes, we established a semiautomated denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) mutation scanning system. All exons of both genes are covered by the DGGE scan, comprising 120 amplicons. We use a semiautomated approach, amplifying all individual amplicons with the same PCR program, after which the amplicons are pooled. DGGE is performed using three slightly different gel conditions. Validation was performed using DNA samples with known sequence variants in 107 of the 120 amplicons; all variants were detected. This DGGE mutation scanning, in combination with a PCR test for two Dutch founder deletions in BRCA1 was then applied in 431 families in which 52 deleterious changes and 70 unclassified variants were found. Fifteen unclassified variants were not reported before. The system was easily adopted by five other laboratories, where in another 3,593 families both exons 11 were analyzed by the protein truncation test (PTT) and the remaining exons by DGGE. In total, a deleterious change (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site mutation, or large deletion) was found in 661 families (16.4%), 462 in BRCA1 (11.5%), 197 in BRCA2 (4.9%), and in two index cases a deleterious change in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 was identified. Eleven deleterious changes in BRCA1 and 36 in BRCA2 had not been reported before. In conclusion, this DGGE mutation screening method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 is proven to be highly sensitive and is easy to adopt, which makes screening of large numbers of patients feasible. The results of screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in more than 4,000 families present a valuable overview of mutations in the Dutch population."}

Oncol.: 17 Suppl 7, vii34-40.", "abstract": "Breast cancer is an extremely complex disease, characterized by a progressive multistep process caused by interactions of both genetic and non-genetic factors. A combination of BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations appears responsible for about 20%-30% of the cases with breast cancer familial history. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 pathogenic mutations largely varies within different populations; in particular, the rate of mutations in Italian breast and/or ovarian cancer families is rather controversial and ranges from 8% to 37%.\nOf the 152 breast/ovarian cancer families counseled in our centre, 99 were selected for BRCA1/2 mutation screening according to our minimal criteria. The entire coding sequences and each intron/exon boundary of BRCA1/2 genes were screened by direct sequencing (PTT limited to BRCA1 exon 11). For each proband, the a priori probability of carrying a pathogenic BRCA1/2 germline mutation was calculated by means of different mutation prediction models (BRCApro, IC and Myriad Table) in order to evaluate their performances.\nOur analysis resulted in the identification of 25 and 52 variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, respectively. Seventeen of them represent novel variants, including four deleterious truncating mutations in the BRCA2 gene (472insA, E33X, C1630X and IVS6+1G>C). Twenty-seven of the 99 probands harbored BRCA1 (n = 15) and BRCA2 (n = 12) pathogenic germline mutations, indicating an overall detection rate of 27.3% and increasing by more than 15% the spectrum of mutations in the Italian population. Furthermore, we found the lowest detection rate (19.4%) in pure hereditary breast cancer family subset. All of the prediction models showed praises and faults, with the IC software being extremely sensitive but poorly specific, compared to BRCApro. In particular all models accumulated most false-negative prediction in the HBC subset. Interestingly preliminary results of a study addressing the presence of genomic rearrangements in HBC probands with BRCApro or IC prediction scores >/=95%, provided evidence for additional mutations undetectable with our conventional screening for point mutations.\nAltogether our results suggest that HBC families, the largest pool in our series, represent an heterogeneous group where the apparently faulty performances of the prediction models might be at least partially explained by the presence of additional kinds of BRCA1/2 alteration (such as genomic rearrangements) or by mutations on different breast cancer related genes."}

A girl (S.G.) became ill at the age of 3.5, suffering form steroid-resistant nephritic syndrome (SRNS) with microscopic hematuria. The renal biopsy showed FSGS accompanied by a complete diffuse effacement of podocyte food processes. Despite intensive and regular immunosuppressive therapy, remission was not achieved. In the control renal biopsy performed a year after cyclosporin A had been applied, 50% of globally sclerosed glomeruli as well as some features of post-cyclosporin damage were found. The girl required renal replacement therapy at the age of 10.5. Dialyzed at the adult dialysis centre she died at the age of 11.5. A boy S.P. was diagnosed with SRNS when he was 11.5 years old. The renal biopsy was performed after one month of treatment and showed mesangial proliferation and diffuse effacement of podocyte food processes. After chlorambucil treatment remission was not achieved, and after methylprednisolon pulse therapy only the reduction of proteinuria was achieved. In a control renal biopsy 10 out of 13 glomeruli were globally sclerosed. At the age of 17 the patient showed chronic renal failure with a fast progression of the disease. In September 2000 the boy started renal replacement therapy, an in June 2001 he received a renal transplant without the recurrence of FGS.

Analysis of CFTR mRNA transcripts in freshly isolated bronchial epithelium from 12 normal adult individuals demonstrated that all had some CFTR mRNA transcripts with exon 9 completely deleted (exon 9- mRNA transcripts). In most (9 of 12), the exon 9- transcripts represented less than or equal to 25% of the total CFTR transcripts. However, in three individuals, the exon 9- transcripts were more abundant, comprising 39, 62 and 66% of all CFTR transcripts. Re-evaluation of the same individuals 2-4 months later showed the same proportions of exon 9- transcripts. Of the 24 CFTR alleles in the 12 individuals, the sequences of the exon-intron junctions relevant to exon 9 deletion (exon 8-intron 8, intron 8-exon 9, exon 9-intron 9, and intron 9-exon 10) were identical except for the intron 8-exon 9 region sequences. Several individuals had varying lengths of a TG repeat in the region between splice branch and splice acceptor consensus sites. Interestingly, one allele in each of the two individuals with 62 and 66% exon 9- transcripts had a TT deletion in the splice acceptor site for exon 9. These observations suggest either the unlikely possibility that sequences in exon 9 are not critical for the functioning of the CFTR or that only a minority of the CFTR mRNA transcripts need to contain exon 9 sequences to produce sufficient amounts of a normal CFTR to maintain a normal clinical phenotype."}

The results show that these variants are all more sensitive to conditions affecting the structural integrity of this protein. The structural analyses of these variants reveal a high population of more unstable beta-domain and distorted hydrophobic core compared to the wild-type human lysozyme, particularly for the two natural amyloidogenic variants D67H and I56T. For the D67H variant, the distance between the mass centers of residues 54 and 67 was found to elongate as a result of the destruction of the hydrogen-bonding network stabilizing the two long loops in the beta-domain. It further accelerates the unfolding of this variant, starting from the hydrophobic core between the alpha- and beta-domains. For the I56T variant, the introduction of a hydrophilic residue in the hydrophobic core directly destroys the native contacts in the alpha-beta interface, leading to fast unfolding. The present results are consistent with the previous hypothesis suggesting that the distortion of the hydrophobic core at the alpha-beta interface putatively results in the formation of the initial \"seed\" for amyloid fibrils."}

The BRCA2-PALB2 interaction is crucial for certain key BRCA2 DNA damage response functions as well as its tumour suppression activity. Here we show, by screening for PALB2 mutations in Finland that a frameshift mutation, c.1592delT, is present at significantly elevated frequency in familial breast cancer cases compared with ancestry-matched population controls. The truncated PALB2 protein caused by this mutation retained little BRCA2-binding capacity and was deficient in homologous recombination and crosslink repair. Further screening of c.1592delT in unselected breast cancer individuals revealed a roughly fourfold enrichment of this mutation in patients compared with controls. Most of the mutation-positive unselected cases had a familial pattern of disease development. In addition, one multigenerational prostate cancer family that segregated the c.1592delT truncation allele was observed.

We used a functional assay that measures the transactivation activity of BRCA1 in combination with analysis of protein modeling based on the structure of BRCA1 BRCT domains.

We determined the predicted cancer association of 22 BRCA1 variants and verified that the common polymorphism S1613G has no effect on BRCA1 function, even when combined with other rare variants. We estimated the specificity and sensitivity of the assay, and by meta-analysis of 47 variants, we show that variants with <45% of wild-type activity can be classified as deleterious whereas variants with >50% can be classified as neutral. In conclusion, we did functional and structure-based analyses on a large series of BRCA1 missense variants and defined a tentative threshold activity for the classification missense variants. By interpreting the validated functional data in light of additional clinical and structural evidence, we conclude that it is possible to classify all missense variants in the BRCA1 COOH-terminal region.

To study the CFTR gene mutations and (TG)(m)(T)(n) polymorphisms in Iranian CBAVD patients with presumed low CF frequency and to better understand the complex regulation of exon 9 splicing among our study population, we analyzed CFTR mutations and (TG)(m)(T)(n) polymorphisms in 112 Iranian CBAVD, 7 congenital unilateral absence of the vas deferens males from Iran, and 84 fertile males as controls. Moreover, we compared the rate of CFTR transcripts with exon 9 (9+) with reduction of the (T)(n) repeat in our study population. Our study showed that the 5T mutation was present with high frequency in our patients. Longer (TG)(m) polymorphic tracts increase the proportion of exon 9 deletion transcripts but only when activated by the 5T allele. The combination of the 5T allele in 1 copy of the CFTR gene with a CF mutation in the other copy is the most common cause of CBAVD in the Iranian population. We also observed the highest level of exon 9+ splicing efficiency among the tested samples with the (TG)(12)(T)(7) allele, which represents the most common intron 8 splice variant allele in the general population. Our results support the idea that a putative role of the (T)(n) repeat is to distance the (TG)(m) repeat from the 3' splice site and that the different alleles at the (T)(n) locus affect the efficiency by which the splice acceptor consensus sequence is recognized."}

Under the polygenic model for breast cancer carriers of multiple low-penetrance alleles are at high risk, but few such alleles have been reliably identified. We analysed 1037 potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate cancer genes in 473 women with two primary breast cancers and 2463 controls. Twenty-five of these SNPs were in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, TP53 and CHEK2. Among the 1037 SNPs there were a few significant findings, but hardly more than would be expected in this large experiment. There was, however, a significant trend in risk with increasing numbers of variant alleles for the 25 SNPs in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, TP53 and CHEK2 (P(trend) = 0.005). For the 21 of these with minor allele frequency <10% this trend was highly significant (P(trend) = 0.00004, odds ratio for 3 or more SNPs = 2.90, 95% CI 1.69-4.97). The individual effects of most of these risk alleles were undetectably small even in this well powered study, but the risk conferred by multiple variants is readily detectable and makes a substantial contribution to susceptibility. A risk score incorporating a suitably weighted sum of all potentially functional variants in these and a few other candidate genes may provide clinically useful identification of women at high genetic risk."}

Most of these genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, CHEK2, ATM, and FANCJ/BRIP1, function in DNA repair, raising the possibility that germ line mutations in other genes that contribute to this process also predispose to breast cancer. Given its close relationship with BRCA2, PALB2 was sequenced in affected probands from 68 BRCA1/BRCA2-negative breast cancer families of Ashkenazi Jewish, French Canadian, or mixed ethnic descent. The average BRCAPRO score was 0.58. A truncating mutation (229delT) was identified in one family with a strong history of breast cancer (seven breast cancers in three female mutation carriers). This mutation and its associated breast cancers were characterized with another recently reported but unstudied mutation (2521delA) that is also associated with a strong family history of breast cancer. There was no loss of heterozygosity in tumors with either mutation. Moreover, comparative genomic hybridization analysis showed major similarities to that of BRCA2 tumors but with some notable differences, especially loss of 18q, a change that was previously unknown in BRCA2 tumors and less common in sporadic breast cancer. This study supports recent observations that PALB2 mutations are present, albeit not frequently, in breast cancer families. The apparently high penetrance noted in this study suggests that at least some PALB2 mutations are associated with a substantially increased risk for the disease."}

On reaching the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, the beta-galactosidase protein associates with the protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA) and neuraminidase proteins to form the lysosomal multienzyme complex (LMC). The correct interaction of these proteins in the complex is essential for their activity. More than 100 mutations have been described in GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio B patients, but few have been further characterized. We expressed 12 mutations suspected to be pathogenic, one known polymorphic change (p.S532G), and a variant described as either a pathogenic or a polymorphic change (p.R521C). Ten of them had not been expressed before. The expression analysis confirmed the pathogenicity of the 12 mutations, whereas the relatively high activity of p.S532G is consistent with its definition as a polymorphism. The results for p.R521C suggest that this change is a low-penetrant disease-causing allele. Furthermore, the effect of these beta-galactosidase changes on the LMC was also studied by coimmunoprecipitations and Western blotting. The alteration of neuraminidase and PPCA patterns in several of the Western blotting analyses performed on patient protein extracts indicated that the LMC is affected in at least some GM1-gangliosidosis and Morquio B patients."}

A total of 51 sequence variants were found in 64 Japanese probands with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing impairment from autosomal recessive families. Among them, at least four missense mutations in six patients from five families were confirmed to be responsible for deafness by segregation study. All mutations detected were missense mutations, corroborating the previous reports regarding DFNB12. The present data confirmed that CDH23 mutations are frequently found and significantly responsible in Japanese. Interestingly, the CDH23 mutation spectrum in Japanese is very different from that found in Caucasians. This Japanese spectrum may be representative of those in Eastern Asian populations and its elucidation is expected to facilitate the molecular diagnosis of DFNB12 and USH1D."}

We identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by resequencing a subgroup of cases and controls, and subsequently genotyped African-American and European-American cases and controls for five missense SNPs, three SNPs within introns, and four SNPs in the 3' untranslated region. No homozygotes or compound heterozygotes were observed for any missense mutation. R138Q carriers were more frequent among FSGS cases relative to controls (OR = 4.9, P = 0.06), but heterozygosity for the other four missense mutations was equally distributed among FSGS cases and controls.

One hundred forty-six of the 189 variations (77%) were observed in only a single individual. The observed variations were not evenly distributed among the LCA patients or among the eight genes. Empirical analysis of this uneven distribution was used to devise a multi-platform mutation detection strategy that is four times more efficient than a more conventional strategy of completely sequencing all of the coding regions of all LCA genes in all subjects. Hardy-Weinberg analysis of the observed mutations suggests that these eight genes are collectively responsible for about 70% of the cases of LCA in North America. The carrier frequency of the most common LCA allele (an intron 26 variation in CEP290) was found to be 2/3,248, which suggests that the overall prevalence of LCA in this population is about 1/81,000. An allele-specific ligation assay (SNPlex) was designed to detect 68 of the most common LCA-causing alleles, and semi-quantitative analysis of the data from this assay also revealed examples of gene deletion and isodisomy in the cohort.\nThe data demonstrates that a tiered screening strategy combining allele-specific detection with automated DNA sequencing can increase the efficiency of autosomal recessive mutation detection four-fold when compared with DNA sequencing alone. However, the very high rate of unique mutations observed in this study (77%) suggests that DNA sequencing will remain an important part of the overall strategy if high sensitivity is to be achieved."}

To explore the spectrum of USH2A disease-causing mutations among Scandinavian USH2 cases, patients from 118 unrelated families of which 27 previously had been found to carry mutations in exons 1-21 were subjected to extensive DNA sequence analysis of the full size USH2A gene. Altogether, 122 USH2A DNA sequence alterations were identified of which 57 were predicted to be disease-causing, 7 were considered to be of uncertain pathogenicity and 58 were predicted to be benign variants. Of 36 novel pathogenic USH2A mutations 31 were located in exons 22-73, specific to the long isoform. USH2A mutations were identified in 89/118 (75.4%) families. In 79/89 (88.8%) of these families two pathogenic mutations were identified whereas in 10/89 (11.2%) families the second mutation remained unidentified.

In the present study, we carried out the mutation analysis in all 69 exons of the CDH23 gene in 56 Usher type 1 probands already screened for mutations in MYO7A. A total of 18 of 56 subjects (32.1%) were observed to have one or two CDH23 variants that are presumed to be pathologic. Twenty one different pathologic genome variants were observed of which 15 were novel. Out of a total of 112 alleles, 31 (27.7%) were considered pathologic. Based on our results it is estimated that about 20% of patients with Usher syndrome type I have CDH23 mutations."}

A proportion of these cases may be attributable, at least in part, to genetic components, but to date, the contribution of genetic components to breast cancer in many of Malaysia's ethnic groups has not been well-characterised.\nGiven that hereditary breast carcinoma is primarily due to germline mutations in one of two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, we have characterised the spectrum of BRCA mutations in a cohort of 37 individuals with early-onset disease (<or=40 years) and no reported family history. Mutational analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was conducted by full sequencing of all exons and intron-exon junctions.\nHere, we report a total of 14 BRCA1 and 17 BRCA2 sequence alterations, of which eight are novel (3 BRCA1 and 5 BRCA2). One deleterious BRCA1 mutation and 2 deleterious BRCA2 mutations, all of which are novel mutations, were identified in 3 of 37 individuals. This represents a prevalence of 2.7% and 5.4% respectively, which is consistent with other studies in other Asian ethnic groups (4-9%)."}

Some genetic variants identified in the cases were then studied in 864 normal controls with no personal or family history of breast cancer. Two protein-truncating PALB2 mutations, 751C>T and 1050_1051delAAinsTCT, were identified in three separate families, and 751C>T was a recurrent mutation. Neither of them, however, were present in the controls (P=0.025). All the truncating mutations occurred in exon 4 of PALB2, and there were still three unclassified variants were detected in the same fragment. We found that exon 4 accounted for 44.1% (15/34) of the person-times carrying with any variant in our study. PALB2 mutations were responsible for approximately 1% of Chinese women with early-onset breast cancer and affected relatives. Our results suggested that a detection of exon 4 before the assay of the whole PALB2 gene might be a cost-effective approach to the screening of Chinese population."}

The limitations of genotyping technology, the choice of mutations to be tested, and the clinical context in which the test is administered can all influence how genetic information is interpreted. This paper describes the conclusions of a consensus conference to address the use and interpretation of CF mutation analysis in clinical settings. Although the diagnosis of CF is usually straightforward, care needs to be exercised in the use and interpretation of genetic tests: genotype information is not the final arbiter of a clinical diagnosis of CF or CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein related disorders. The diagnosis of these conditions is primarily based on the clinical presentation, and is supported by evaluation of CFTR function (sweat testing, nasal potential difference) and genetic analysis. None of these features are sufficient on their own to make a diagnosis of CF or CFTR-related disorders. Broad genotype/phenotype associations are useful in epidemiological studies, but CFTR genotype does not accurately predict individual outcome. The use of CFTR genotype for prediction of prognosis in people with CF at the time of their diagnosis is not recommended. The importance of communication between clinicians and medical genetic laboratories is emphasized. The results of testing and their implications should be reported in a manner understandable to the clinicians caring for CF patients."}

A neural network splicing prediction model individualized one BRCA1 and one BRCA2 intronic variants able to determine alternative splicing.

Identification of deleterious nsSNPs from tolerant nsSNPs is important for characterizing the genetic basis of human disease, assessing individual susceptibility to disease, understanding the pathogenesis of disease, identifying molecular targets for drug treatment, and conducting individualized pharmacotherapy. Numerous nsSNPs have been found in genes coding for human cytochromes P450 (P450s), but there is poor knowledge on the relationship between the genotype and phenotype of nsSNPs in P450s. We have identified 791 validated nsSNPs in 57 validated human CYP genes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism and Swiss-Prot database. Using the polymorphism phenotyping (PolyPhen; http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT; http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html) algorithms, 39 to 43% of nsSNPs in CYP genes were predicted to have functional impacts on protein function. There was a significant concordance between the predicted results using the SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms. A prediction accuracy analysis found that approximately 70% of nsSNPs were predicted correctly as damaging. Of nsSNPs predicted as deleterious, the prediction scores by the SIFT and PolyPhen algorithms were significantly associated with the numbers of nsSNPs with known phenotype confirmed by benchmarking studies, including site-directed mutagenesis analysis and clinical association studies. These amino acid substitutions are supposed to be the pathogenetic basis for the alteration of P450 enzyme activity and the association with disease susceptivity. This prediction analysis of nsSNPs in human CYP genes would be useful for further genotype-phenotype studies on individual differences in drug clearance and clinical response."}

Specifically, substitution of 31st Threonine to Arginine selectively abrogates the GTP-binding ability of Arl6 without affecting GDP-binding/dissociating properties. Furthermore, all the BBS mutations in Arl6 result in low expression of the mutant proteins, which can be restored by the inhibition of the proteasome.

This study aimed to determine the involvement of PALB2 mutations in a cohort of 48 young (29-45 years) South African breast cancer patients unselected for family history of breast cancer. The complete coding region and intron-exon boundaries of PALB2 were analyzed. A novel truncating mutation, c.697delG (V233fs) was identified in one patient. A missense variant (E211G), identified in another patient, appears to be segregating with the disease, but in silico analysis using SIFT, PolyPhen and A-GVGD, indicates that this variant is nonpathogenic. In addition, four other missense, one synonymous and three intronic variants were detected, all of which appear polymorphic. This represents the second study to analyze the role of PALB2 in early-onset breast cancer patients unselected for family history. The first study, of a Chinese population, established that PALB2 was responsible for 1.3% of early-onset breast cancer cases.

As out-of-frame splicing defects lead to a marked reduction of the level of the mutant mRNA cleared through nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cDNA-based test was developed to show the resulting allelic imbalance (AI). Fifty-four VUSs identified in 53 hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) patients without BRCA1/2 mutation were included in the study. Two frequent exonic single-nucleotide polymorphisms on both BRCA1 and BRCA2 were investigated by using a semiquantitative single-nucleotide primer extension approach and the cDNA allelic ratios obtained were corrected using genomic DNA ratios from the same sample. A total of five samples showed AI. Subsequent transcript analyses ruled out the implication of VUS on AI and identified a deletion encompassing BRCA2 exons 12 and 13 in one sample. No sequence abnormality was found in the remaining four samples, suggesting implication of cis- or trans-acting factors in allelic expression regulation that might be disease causative in these HBOC patients. Overall, this study showed that AI screening is a simple way to detect deleterious splicing defects and that a major role for VUSs and deep intronic mutations in splicing anomalies is unlikely in BRCA1/2 genes. Methods to analyze gene expression and identify regulatory elements in BRCA1/2 are now needed to complement standard approaches to mutational analysis."}

MODY is genetically heterogeneous, with 8 distinct MODY genes identified to date and more believed to exist. We resequenced 732 kb of genomic sequence at 8p23 in 6 MODY families unlinked to known MODY genes that showed evidence of linkage at that location. Of the 410 sequence differences that we identified, 5 had a frequency <1% in the general population and segregated with diabetes in 3 of the families, including the 2 showing the strongest support for linkage at this location. The 5 mutations were all placed within 100 kb corresponding to the BLK gene. One resulted in an Ala71Thr substitution; the other 4 were noncoding and determined decreased in vitro promoter activity in reporter gene experiments. We found that BLK--a nonreceptor tyrosine-kinase of the src family of proto-oncogenes--is expressed in beta-cells where it enhances insulin synthesis and secretion in response to glucose by up-regulating transcription factors Pdx1 and Nkx6.1. These actions are greatly attenuated by the Ala71Thr mutation. These findings point to BLK as a previously unrecognized modulator of beta-cell function, the deficit of which may lead to the development of diabetes."}

Little is known about the pathogenesis of these tumors. The BCL10 gene, a proapoptotic signaling molecule involved in the Apaf-1/caspase-9 cell death pathway, may act as a tumor suppressor gene in multiple types of tumors including testicular GCTs.\nTo evaluate whether alterations in the BCL10 gene play a role in the genesis of intracranial GCTs, we analyzed the BCL10 gene in 10 pure germinomas (PGs) and 10 nongerminomatous GCTs.\nWe found no inactivating mutations; however, 5 of 10 PGs and 1 of 10 nongerminomatous GCTs manifested specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that carried an amino acid substitution at codon 5 in exon 1 or codon 162 in exon 3. This SNP occurs at higher frequency in patients with PGs than healthy individuals (p = 0.07). CSF dissemination occurred in 4 of our 6 patients manifesting SNP (p = 0.037).\nOur data suggest that this specific SNP in the BCL10 gene may be partly responsible for the tumorigenesis of PG in Japanese individuals, and may be associated with the aggressive nature of these tumors."}

However, the spectrum and frequency distribution of ATM mutations that confer increased risk of breast cancer have been controversial. To assess the contribution of rare variants in this gene to risk of breast cancer, we pooled data from seven published ATM case-control mutation-screening studies, including a total of 1544 breast cancer cases and 1224 controls, with data from our own mutation screening of an additional 987 breast cancer cases and 1021 controls. Using an in silico missense-substitution analysis that provides a ranking of missense substitutions from evolutionarily most likely to least likely, we carried out analyses of protein-truncating variants, splice-junction variants, and rare missense variants. We found marginal evidence that the combination of ATM protein-truncating and splice-junction variants contribute to breast cancer risk. There was stronger evidence that a subset of rare, evolutionarily unlikely missense substitutions confer increased risk. On the basis of subset analyses, we hypothesize that rare missense substitutions falling in and around the FAT, kinase, and FATC domains of the protein may be disproportionately responsible for that risk and that a subset of these may confer higher risk than do protein-truncating variants. We conclude that a comparison between the graded distributions of missense substitutions in cases versus controls can complement analyses of truncating variants and help identify susceptibility genes and that this approach will aid interpretation of the data emerging from new sequencing technologies."}

All fetuses presented 2 CFTR mutations, which were classified according to the severity of the disease: CF/CF (n = 38); CF/CFTR-related disorders (n = 1); and CF/unknown variant (n = 4). The relationships between clinical CF status, CFTR mutations, and AF-DE pattern were studied.\nOf 38 severely affected CF fetuses, an \"obstructive\" AF-DE pattern was observed in 15 of 15 samples collected before 22 weeks, irrespective of the CFTR mutation (diagnostic sensitivity, 100%; diagnostic specificity, 99.8%).

The phenotypes caused by PKHD1 mutations are similarly complicated, ranging from perinatally-fatal PKD to CHF presenting in adulthood with mild kidney disease. To date, more than 300 mutations have been described throughout PKHD1. Most reported cohorts include a large proportion of perinatal-onset ARPKD patients; mutation detection rates vary between 42% and 87%. Here we report PKHD1 sequencing results on 78 ARPKD/CHF patients from 68 families. Differing from previous investigations, our study required survival beyond 6 months and included many adults with a CHF-predominant phenotype. We identified 77 PKHD1 variants (41 novel) including 19 truncating, 55 missense, 2 splice, and 1 small in-frame deletion. Using computer-based prediction tools (GVGD, PolyPhen, SNAP), we achieved a mutation detection rate of 79%, ranging from 63% in the CHF-predominant group to 82% in the remaining families. Prediction of the pathogenicity of missense variants will remain challenging until a functional assay is available. In the meantime, use of PKHD1 sequencing data for clinical decisions requires caution, especially when only novel or rare missense variants are identified."}

The aim was to characterise the phenotype of patients with these substitutions and to determine their functional significance.\nA database of genetic tests undertaken at the US National Institutes of Health was interrogated. Symptoms and signs were classified according to Tel-Hashomer criteria. Coimmunoprecipitation techniques were employed to determine the variants' effects on pyrin/PSTPIP1 interactions.\nA total of 40 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic family members with these substitutions were identified. P369S and R408Q were found in cis, and cosegregated in all patients sequenced. Clinical details were available on 22 patients. In all, 5 patients had symptoms and signs fulfilling a clinical diagnosis of FMF, and 15 received colchicine. In patients not achieving the criteria, trials of anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents resulted in partial or no benefit; resolution of symptoms was noted in those receiving anakinra. The carrier frequency was higher in the patient cohort than in controls but was not statistically significant. Coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that these pyrin variants did not affect binding to PSTPIP1.\nP369S/R408Q substitutions are associated with a highly variable phenotype, and are infrequently associated with typical FMF symptoms, however a trial of colchicine is warranted in all. Functional and modelling studies suggest that these substitutions do not significantly affect pyrin's interaction with PSTPIP1.

In order to assess the added value of mutation probability methods, we have retrospectively calculated the BRCAPRO and Myriad II probabilities in 306 probands who had previously been selected for DNA-analysis according to criteria based on familial history of cancer. DNA-analysis identified 52 mutations (16.9%) and 11 unclassified variants (UVs, 3.6%). Compared to cancer history, a threshold > or = 10% with BRCAPRO or with Myriad II excluded about 40% of the patients from analysis, including four with a mutation and probabilities <10% with both programs. All four probands had a BRCA2 mutation. BRCAPRO and Myriad II showed similar specificity at 10% threshold, overall BRCAPRO was more sensitive than Myriad II for the detection of mutations. Only two of the probands with an UV had probabilities >20% with BRCAPRO and Myriad II. In summary, BRCAPRO and Myriad II are more efficient than cancer history alone to exclude patients without a mutation. BRCAPRO performs better for the detection of BRCA1 mutations than of BRCA2 mutations. The Myriad II scores provided no additional information than the BRCAPRO scores alone for the detection of patients with a mutation. The use of thresholds excluded from analysis the majority of patients carrying an UV."}

CFTR mutations were detected in the majority (68%) of CAVD patients and in significant proportions in azoospermic (31%) and oligospermic (22%) men. Carrier frequency among partners of infertile men was 16/70, exceeding that of controls (6/96) significantly (P = 0.0005). Thus, in 23% of infertile couples both partners were carriers, increasing the risk for their offspring to inherit two mutations to 25% or 50%. This study emphasizes the necessity to offer extended CFTR mutation screening and counselling not only to patients with CAVD but also to azoospermic and oligozoospermic men and their partners before undergoing assisted reproduction techniques. The identification of rare and/or mild mutations will not be a reason to abstain from parenthood, but will allow adequate treatment in children at risk for atypical or mild cystic fibrosis as soon as they develop any symptoms."}

A total of 2.63 megabases of genomic sequence of the MEFV gene were scanned by direct sequencing. The collection of rare missense mutations (all heterozygotes and tested in the aggregate) had a significant elevated frequency of transmission to affecteds (p = 0.0085, one-sided, exact binomial test). Our data provide evidence that rare missense variants of the MEFV gene are, collectively, associated with risk of FMS and are present in a subset of 15% of FMS patients. This subset had, on average, high levels of plasma IL-1beta (p = 0.019) compared to FMS patients without rare variants, unaffected family members with or without rare variants, and unrelated controls of unknown genotype. IL-1beta is a cytokine associated with the function of the MEFV gene and thought to be responsible for its symptoms of fever and muscle aches.\nSince misregulation of IL-1beta expression has been predicted for patients with mutations in the MEFV gene, we conclude that patients heterozygous for rare missense variants of this gene may be predisposed to FMS, possibly triggered by environmental factors."}

More than 75% of full-term neonates with PCD have \"neonatal respiratory distress\" requiring supplemental oxygen for days to weeks. Chronic airway infection, apparent in early childhood, results in bronchiectasis that is almost uniformly present in adulthood. Nasal congestion and sinus infections, apparent in early childhood, persist through adulthood. Chronic/recurrent ear infection, apparent in most young children, can be associated with transient or later irreversible hearing loss. Situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of all visceral organs with no apparent physiologic consequences) is present in 40%-50% of individuals with PCD; heterotaxy (discordance of right and left patterns of ordinarily asymmetric structures that can be associated with significant malformations) is present in approximately 12%. Virtually all males with PCD are infertile as a result of abnormal sperm motility.\nThe diagnosis of PCD can be established by clinical phenotype and by ciliary ultrastructural analysis or molecular genetic testing. About two thirds of probands can be diagnosed by the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the 32 genes known to be associated with PCD.\nTreatment of manifestations: Aggressive measures to enhance clearance of mucus (chest percussion and postural drainage, oscillatory vest, breathing maneuvers to facilitate clearance of distal airways) and prompt antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections of the airways (bronchitis, sinusitis, and otitis media); consideration of lobectomy for localized bronchiectasis; lung transplantation for end-stage lung disease; sinus surgery for extensive sinus infections; consideration of PE tube placement for chronic otitis media; speech therapy and hearing aids as needed. Surgical intervention as needed for congenital heart disease. ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) or artificial insemination by donor sperm (AIDS) for male infertility. Prevention of secondary complications: Routine immunizations (including influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine) to prevent respiratory infections; education about infection control including attention to hand washing, avoidance of sick contacts, and proper cleaning/disinfecting of respiratory devices; early use of antibiotics for respiratory illnesses (directed by prior respiratory cultures). Surveillance: Follow up by a pulmonologist to monitor lung function and pathogens in sputum cultures as well as to assess pulmonary disease extent/progression; for those with chronic otitis media, routine hearing evaluation until the teenage years. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Cough suppressants; exposure to respiratory pathogens, tobacco smoke, and other air pollutants and respiratory irritants.\nPCD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected individual are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one allele with a pathogenic variant. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known."}

(eds)., GeneReviews, University of Washington, Seattle, Seattle (WA).", "abstract": "Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is divided into two phenotypes: type 1 and type 2. FMF type 1 is characterized by recurrent short episodes of inflammation and serositis including fever, peritonitis, synovitis, pleuritis, and, rarely, pericarditis and meningitis. The symptoms and severity vary among affected individuals, sometimes even among members of the same family. Amyloidosis, which can lead to renal failure, is the most severe complication, if untreated. FMF type 2 is characterized by amyloidosis as the first clinical manifestation of FMF in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.\nThe diagnosis of FMF is established in a proband with Tel Hashomer clinical criteria of major and minor features. Major features include fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and skin eruption. Minor features include increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), leukocytosis, and elevated serum fibrinogen. Identification of biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants on molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Up to 25% of individuals with FMF have only one MEFV pathogenic variant identified. A six-month trial of colchicine therapy can establish the diagnosis if molecular testing is inconclusive.\nTreatment of manifestations: Treatment of an acute episode is mainly supportive, including administration of intravenous saline for hydration and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol, or dipyrone for pain relief; treatment of febrile and inflammatory episodes with NSAIDs; routine treatment of end-stage renal disease, including renal transplantation. Prevention of primary manifestations: Homozygotes for the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant or compound heterozygotes for p.Met694Val and another disease-causing allele require lifelong treatment with colchicine (1-2 mg/day orally in adults and 0.5-1 mg/day in children according to age and weight). Colchicine prevents the inflammatory attacks and the deposition of amyloid. Individuals who do not have the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant and who are only mildly affected (those with infrequent inflammatory attacks) should either be treated with colchicine or monitored every six months for the presence of proteinuria. Individuals who are homozygous or compound heterozygous for p.Glu148Gln should only be treated with colchicine if they develop severe inflammatory episodes and/or proteinuria as a result of amyloidosis. Symptomatic individuals with a heterozygous MEFV pathogenic variant may benefit from a trial of colchicine. Individuals who are unresponsive to colchicine may respond to intravenous colchicine or one of several other medications. Surveillance: Annual physical examination, urine spot test for protein, and evaluation for hematuria for all affected individuals including those treated with colchicine; consider monitoring of acute-phase reactants (ESR and fibrinogen levels) at regular intervals during attack-free periods, particularly in those with the p.Met694Val pathogenic variant. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Possible worsening of symptoms with cisplatin; possible adverse effect on renal transplant graft survival with cyclosporin A. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Offer molecular genetic testing to all first-degree relatives and other family members (regardless of symptoms) especially when the p.Met694Val allele is present because renal amyloidosis can be prevented with colchicine treatment.\nFMF is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, although recent studies have suggested that some heterozygotes manifest a spectrum of findings from classic FMF to mild FMF. For autosomal recessive FMF: In general, both parents of an affected individual with biallelic MEFV pathogenic variants are unaffected heterozygotes. However, in populations with a high carrier rate and/or a high rate of consanguineous marriages, it is possible that one or both parents have biallelic pathogenic variants and are affected. Symptomatic heterozygotes have also been reported. Thus, it is appropriate to consider molecular genetic testing of the parents of the proband to establish their genetic status. If both parents are heterozygotes, the risk to sibs of inheriting two pathogenic variants and being affected is 25%. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the MEFV pathogenic variants in the family are known."}

Others present as young adults with nonspecific symptoms and abnormal serum iron studies or as adults with abnormal serum iron studies and signs of organ involvement including cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, and arthropathy.\nThe diagnosis of TFR2-HHC is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TFR2 on molecular genetic testing.\nTreatment of manifestations: Removal of excess iron by routine phlebotomy to maintain serum ferritin concentration at 50 ng/mL or lower and transferrin-iron saturation below 50%; lifelong hormone replacement therapy for hypogonadism; gonadotropins for fertility/pregnancy; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and joint replacement for arthropathy; routine treatment for cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, and hepatic complications. Prevention of primary manifestations: Routine phlebotomy; see Treatment of manifestations. Surveillance: Monitoring serum ferritin concentration every three to four months once serum ferritin concentration is lower than 50 ng/mL. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Medicinal iron and nutritional supplements containing iron, excessive alcohol intake, vitamin C supplements, uncooked seafood. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the pathogenic variants in the family are known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives to allow early diagnosis and treatment.\nTFR2-HHC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic and do not have abnormalities of iron parameters. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible once both pathogenic variants in the family have been identified."}

(eds)., GeneReviews, University of Washington, Seattle, Seattle (WA).", "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a lipid storage disease characterized by infantile-onset diarrhea, childhood-onset cataract, adolescent- to young adult-onset tendon xanthomas, and adult-onset progressive neurologic dysfunction (dementia, psychiatric disturbances, pyramidal and/or cerebellar signs, dystonia, atypical parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures). Chronic diarrhea from infancy may be the earliest clinical manifestation. In approximately 75% of affected individuals, cataracts are the first finding, often appearing in the first decade of life. Xanthomas appear in the second or third decade; they occur on the Achilles tendon, the extensor tendons of the elbow and hand, the patellar tendon, and the neck tendons. Xanthomas have been reported in the lung, bones, and central nervous system. Some individuals show cognitive impairment from early infancy, whereas the majority have normal or only slightly impaired intellectual function until puberty; dementia with slow deterioration in intellectual abilities occurs in the 20s in more than 50% of individuals. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as behavioral changes, hallucinations, agitation, aggression, depression, and suicide attempts may be prominent. Pyramidal signs (i.e., spasticity) and/or cerebellar signs almost invariably become evident between ages 20 and 30 years. The biochemical abnormalities that distinguish CTX from other conditions with xanthomas include high plasma and tissue cholestanol concentration, normal-to-low plasma cholesterol concentration, decreased chenodeoxycholic acid, increased concentration of bile alcohols and their glyconjugates, and increased concentrations of cholestanol and apolipoprotein B in cerebrospinal fluid.\nThe diagnosis of CTX is established in a proband with the above clinical and biochemical findings and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CYP27A1.\nTreatment of manifestations: Long-term treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) normalizes bile acid synthesis, normalizes plasma and CSF concentration of cholestanol, and improves neurophysiologic findings.

Although MCHP and SCKS were previously distinguished by height (maximum height in SCKS was equivalent to the minimum height in MCPH), stature is no longer a discriminating feature, leading to the conclusion that these phenotypes constitute a spectrum rather than distinct entities. Microcephaly is characterized by: Onset during the second trimester of gestation; Occipito-frontal head circumference (OFC) at birth equal to or less than -2 SD below the mean for sex, age, and ethnicity; Slower than average increase in OFC after birth. Variable findings in the MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders include: Brain structure (which is normal in the majority); Degree of cognitive impairment (usually mild to moderate without significant motor delay in the majority of persons with MCPH and more severe in those with SCKS and MCPH with brain malformations); Degree of short stature; Craniosynostosis (which may be secondary to poor brain growth).\nThe diagnosis of MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders is based on clinical findings, brain imaging that shows reduced brain volume with grossly normal architecture, family history consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance, and molecular genetic testing when available. The genes in which biallelic mutation is known to cause MCPH-SCKS spectrum disorders are separated into those that are currently known to be associated with: MCPH phenotype only: MCPH1 (locus name MCPH1), WDR62 (MCPH2), CDK5RAP2 (MCPH3), KNL1 (MCPH4), ASPM (MCPH5), STIL (MCPH7), CEP135 (MCPH8), and CDK6 (MCPH12); SCKS phenotype only: ATR (locus name SCKL1), NIN (SCKL7), and ATRIP; and MCPH, SCKS, and/or intermediate phenotypes: RBBP8 (locus name SCKL2), CEP152 (MCPH9/SCKL5), CENPJ (MCPH6/SCKL4), CEP63 (SCKL6), and PHC1 (MCPH11). Of note, roughly one half to three quarters of western Europeans or North Americans with MCPH have no identified gene defect; in contrast, the proportion of individuals with identified pathogenic variants appears higher in persons from the Indo-Pakistan area.\nTreatment of manifestations: Supportive therapy including special education, speech and language therapy, behavioral therapy, occupational therapy, and community services for families.

A combination of in vivo assays with subsequent in vitro validation suggests that a significant fraction of BBS-associated mutations have a dominant-negative mode of action. Moreover, we find that a subset of common alleles, previously considered to be benign, are, in fact, detrimental to protein function and can interact with strong rare alleles to modulate disease presentation. These data represent a comprehensive evaluation of genetic load in a multilocus disease. Importantly, superimposition of these results to human genetics data suggests a previously underappreciated complexity in disease architecture that might be shared among diverse clinical phenotypes."}

We examined properties of a series of 27 mutant variants, which together represent 70% of known alleles observed in patients with homocystinuria due to CBS deficiency. The median amount of SDS-soluble mutant CBS polypeptides in the pellet after centrifugation of bacterial extracts was increased by 50% compared to the wild type. Moreover, mutants formed on average only 12% of tetramers and their median activity reached only 3% of the wild-type enzyme. In contrast to the wild-type CBS about half of mutants were not activated by S-adenosylmethionine. Expression at 18 degrees C substantially increased the activity of five mutants in parallel with increasing the amounts of tetramers. We further analyzed the role of solvent accessibility of mutants as a determinant of their folding and activity. Buried mutations formed on average less tetramers and exhibited 23 times lower activity than the solvent exposed mutations. In summary, our results show that topology of mutations predicts in part the behavior of mutant CBS, and that misfolding may be an important and frequent pathogenic mechanism in CBS deficiency."}

Clinical correlations with these mutations have not been carried out. We determined the relative frequency of the mutations and their association with plasma levels of factor XI clotting activity and bleeding, analyzing the mutations with the polymerase chain reaction and restriction-enzyme digestion.\nThe Type II and Type III mutations had similar frequencies among 43 Ashkenazi Jewish probands with severe factor XI deficiency; these two mutations accounted for 49 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of a total of 86 analyzed alleles.

It is associated with defects in MTP-mediated lipid transfer onto apolipoprotein B (APOB) and impaired secretion of APOB-containing lipoproteins. Recently, MTP was shown to regulate the CD1 family of lipid antigen-presenting molecules, but little is known about immune function in ABL patients. Here, we have shown that ABL is characterized by immune defects affecting presentation of self and microbial lipid antigens by group 1 (CD1a, CD1b, CD1c) and group 2 (CD1d) CD1 molecules. In dendritic cells isolated from ABL patients, MTP deficiency was associated with increased proteasomal degradation of group 1 CD1 molecules. Although CD1d escaped degradation, it was unable to load antigens and exhibited functional defects similar to those affecting the group 1 CD1 molecules. The reduction in CD1 function resulted in impaired activation of CD1-restricted T and invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and reduced numbers and phenotypic alterations of iNKT cells consistent with central and peripheral CD1 defects in vivo. These data highlight MTP as a unique regulator of human metabolic and immune pathways and reveal that ABL is not only a disorder of lipid metabolism but also an immune disease involving CD1."}

To evaluate the proportion of French Canadian non-BRCA1/BRCA2 families with high risk of breast cancer potentially harboring alterations in these three breast cancer susceptibility genes, the whole coding and flanking intronic sequences were analyzed in a series of 96 high-risk breast cancer individuals.

Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, direct sequencing, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were employed to screen for mutations in the BRCA2 gene, followed by direct sequencing of the PALB2 gene in BRCA2-negative MBC cases. Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations were identified in 18 of the 115 MBC cases, including four of the ten cases (40%) from breast cancer families and 14 of the 105 cases (13%) unselected for family history of breast cancer.

We have identified mutations in SOX17, an HMG-box transcription factor and Wnt signaling antagonist, in eight patients with CAKUT (seven vesico-ureteric reflux, one pelvic obstruction). One mutation, c.775T>A (p.Y259N), recurred in six patients. Four cases derived from two small families; renal scars with urinary infection represented the main symptom at presentation in all but two patients. Transfection studies indicated a 5-10-fold increase in the levels of the mutant protein relative to wild-type SOX17 in transfected kidney cells. Moreover we observed a corresponding increase in the ability of SOX17 p.Y259N to inhibit Wnt/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity, which is known to regulate multiple stages of kidney and urinary tract development. In conclusion, SOX17 p.Y259N mutation is recurrent in patients with CAKUT. Our data shows that this mutation correlates with an inappropriate accumulation of SOX17-p.Y259N protein and inhibition of the \u03b2-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway. These data indicate a role of SOX17 in human kidney and urinary tract development and implicate the SOX17-p.Y259N mutation as a causative factor in CAKUT."}

We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location, allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued the vast majority of common variation, over 95% of the currently accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250 to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100 variants previously implicated in inherited disorders.

CFTR mutations were more frequent in family members with RA-DB than in those with RA only (OR 5.30, 95% CI 2.48 to 11.33; p<5\u00d710(-5)). They cosegregated with RA-DB in the families (sib-TDT=10.82, p=0.005).\nRA-DB should be added to the list of phenotypes in which CFTR mutations are pathogenic. CFTR mutation is the first genetic defect linked to an extra-articular feature of RA to be described. CFTR mutations in patients with RA appear to be an important marker of the risk of associated DB, which has been linked to a less favourable prognosis."}

Truncating PALB2 mutations were identified in 4/203 (2%) breast cancer patients with bilateral disease. The two nonsense mutations, p.E545X and p.Q921X, have not been previously described whereas the two other mutations, p.R414X and c.509_510delGA, are recurrent.

We assessed 585 Slovak HBOC for the presence of mutations in BRCA genes. Sequencing revealed mutations in 100 families, representing 17.1% (88 and 12% of mutations were located in BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively). Four of the mutations, c.80+4del4, c.1938_1947del10 and c.1166delG in BRCA1 and c.6589delA in BRCA2 gene have been described only in Slovak population. Using MLPA analysis, we detected two large genomic rearrangements in three families, a deletion of exons 21 and 22, and a rare deletion of a whole BRCA1 gene. Twenty-seven different variants of uncertain clinical effect (four novel) and 14 distinct SNP BRCA1 haplotypes were detected. Their potential effect was considered using the prediction software packages Align-GVGD, Pmut and Polyphen. We observed that the best clinical criterion for the initiation of BRCA1 analysis is the presence of breast cancer at 40 years of age in the association with the presence of ovarian cancer diagnosed around the age of 50. Conversely, the best clinical criterion for starting with BRCA2 analysis is the presence of breast cancer diagnosed in older age (above 50), or the presence of breast cancer in conjunction with carcinomas at different sites e.g., prostate, colorectum, ovary and uterus. Finally we have seen that the analyses of other HBOC risk gene TP53 and specific mutation in CHEK2*c.1100delC in Slovak HBOC families were not efficient since no mutations were found in these genes."}

Although individually uncommon, Mendelian diseases collectively account for ~20% of infant mortality and ~10% of pediatric hospitalizations. Preconception screening, together with genetic counseling of carriers, has resulted in remarkable declines in the incidence of several severe recessive diseases including Tay-Sachs disease and cystic fibrosis. However, extension of preconception screening to most severe disease genes has hitherto been impractical. Here, we report a preconception carrier screen for 448 severe recessive childhood diseases. Rather than costly, complete sequencing of the human genome, 7717 regions from 437 target genes were enriched by hybrid capture or microdroplet polymerase chain reaction, sequenced by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to a depth of up to 2.7 gigabases, and assessed with stringent bioinformatic filters. At a resultant 160x average target coverage, 93% of nucleotides had at least 20x coverage, and mutation detection/genotyping had ~95% sensitivity and ~100% specificity for substitution, insertion/deletion, splicing, and gross deletion mutations and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. In 104 unrelated DNA samples, the average genomic carrier burden for severe pediatric recessive mutations was 2.8 and ranged from 0 to 7. The distribution of mutations among sequenced samples appeared random. Twenty-seven percent of mutations cited in the literature were found to be common polymorphisms or misannotated, underscoring the need for better mutation databases as part of a comprehensive carrier testing strategy. Given the magnitude of carrier burden and the lower cost of testing compared to treating these conditions, carrier screening by NGS made available to the general population may be an economical way to reduce the incidence of and ameliorate suffering associated with severe recessive childhood disorders."}

PALB2 mutation analysis was performed in 94 non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer patients with a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer. Two truncating PALB2 mutations, c.3549C>CA and c.2962C>CT, were identified resulting in a mutation prevalence of 2.1%.

The proband with the c.2962C>CT mutation had a father and paternal aunt diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; neither relative was available for testing. Two novel PALB2 missense variants were also found, one of which was deemed potentially deleterious. The prevalence rate of PALB2 mutations in a non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer population specifically selected for a family history of pancreatic cancer does not appear to be significantly increased compared to that observed in other breast cancer populations studied thus far. Further evaluation is needed to determine the prevalence of PALB2 mutations and the clinical utility of such testing in those individuals affected with both breast and pancreatic cancers."}

Because 18 to 40% of suspected GS patients carry only one SLC12A3 mutant allele, large genomic rearrangements may account for unidentified mutations. Here, we directly sequenced genomic DNA from a large cohort of 448 unrelated patients suspected of having GS. We found 172 distinct mutations, of which 100 were unreported previously. In 315 patients (70%), we identified two mutations; in 81 patients (18%), we identified one; and in 52 patients (12%), we did not detect a mutation. In 88 patients, we performed a search for large rearrangements by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and found nine deletions and two duplications in 24 of the 51 heterozygous patients. A second technique confirmed each rearrangement. Based on the breakpoints of seven deletions, nonallelic homologous recombination by Alu sequences and nonhomologous end-joining probably favor these intragenic deletions. In summary, missense mutations account for approximately 59% of the mutations in Gitelman's syndrome, and there is a predisposition to large rearrangements (6% of our cases) caused by the presence of repeated sequences within the SLC12A3 gene."}

As a consequence, a family history for the disease and an early age of onset should not be used as the only criteria for mutation analysis of BRCA1/2. The relatively high mutation detection ratio suggests that the prevalence of BRCA1/2 may be underestimated, especially in sporadic patients who developed breast and ovarian cancer.

We report a case of pancreatic adenocarcinoma arising in a 60-year-old carrier of a rare BRCA2 (1153insertionT) germline mutation. The patient received gemcitabine without any response and actually progression of the disease had occurred. Therefore cisplatin was added in combination with gemcitabine. A dramatic complete response to therapy was encountered with no evidence of disease in both CT scans and markers (CA19-9). In conclusion, in patients with known BRCA mutation associated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the addition of a DNA cross-linking agent such as cisplatin should be considered. Physicians should consider BRCA mutation testing when the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is established, especially when the patient belongs to an ethnic group where founder mutations exist, and/or there is strong personal or family history of cancer.

Identification of 21 novel mutations highlights the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. Differences in European and Tunisian patients, including the high frequency of the M390R mutation in Europeans, emphasize the population specificity of BBS mutations with potential diagnostic implications.

In parallel, we tested them by using functional splicing assays. A total of 10 VUSs were predicted by two or more programs to induce a significant reduction of splice site strength or activation of cryptic splice sites or generation of new splice sites. Minigene-based splicing assays confirmed four of these predictions. Five additional VUSs, all at internal exon positions, were not predicted to induce alterations of splice sites, but revealed variable levels of exon skipping, most likely induced by the modification of exonic splicing regulatory elements. We provide new data in favor of the pathogenic nature of the variants BRCA1 c.212+3A>G and BRCA1 c.5194-12G>A, which induced aberrant out-of-frame mRNA forms.

Current scanning methods used for the detection of germline sequence variants are laborious as they require post-PCR manipulation. High resolution melting (HRM) is a cost-effective rapid screening strategy, which readily detects heterozygous variants by melting curve analysis of PCR products. It is well suited to screening genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 as germline pathogenic mutations in these genes are always heterozygous.\nAssays for the analysis of all coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were designed, and optimised. A final set of 94 assays which ran under identical amplification conditions were chosen for BRCA1 (36) and BRCA2 (58). Significant attention was placed on primer design to enable reproducible detection of mutations within the amplicon while minimising unnecessary detection of polymorphisms. Deoxyinosine residues were incorporated into primers that overlay intronic polymorphisms. Multiple 384 well plates were used to facilitate high throughput.\n169 BRCA1 and 239 BRCA2 known sequence variants were used to test the amplicons. We also performed an extensive blinded validation of the protocol with 384 separate patient DNAs. All heterozygous variants were detected with the optimised assays.\nThis is the first HRM approach to screen the entire coding region of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes using one set of reaction conditions in a multi plate 384 well format using specifically designed primers. The parallel screening of a relatively large number of samples enables better detection of sequence variants. HRM has the advantages of decreasing the necessary sequencing by more than 90%. This markedly reduced cost of sequencing will result in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing becoming accessible to individuals who currently do not undergo mutation testing because of the significant costs involved."}

Because it typically results in end-stage kidney disease, the steroid-resistant subtype (SRNS) of INS is especially important when it occurs in children. The present study included 29 affected and 22 normal individuals from 17 SRNS families; genome-wide analysis was performed with Affymetrix 250K SNP arrays followed by homozygosity mapping. A large homozygous stretch on chromosomal region 12p12 was identified in one consanguineous family with two affected siblings. Direct sequencing of protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O (PTPRO; also known as glomerular epithelial protein-1 [GLEPP1]) showed homozygous c.2627+1G>T donor splice-site mutation. This mutation causes skipping of the evolutionarily conserved exon 16 (p.Glu854_Trp876del) at the RNA level. Immunohistochemistry with GLEPP1 antibody showed a similar staining pattern in the podocytes of the diseased and control kidney tissues. We used a highly polymorphic intragenic DNA marker-D12S1303-to search for homozygosity in 120 Turkish and 13 non-Turkish individuals in the PodoNet registry. This analysis yielded 17 candidate families, and a distinct homozygous c.2745+1G>A donor splice-site mutation in PTPRO was further identified via DNA sequencing in a second Turkish family. This mutation causes skipping of exon 19, and this introduces a premature stop codon at the very beginning of exon 20 (p.Asn888Lysfs*3) and causes degradation of mRNA via nonsense-mediated decay. Immunohistochemical analysis showed complete absence of immunoreactive PTPRO. Ultrastructural alterations, such as diffuse foot process fusion and extensive microvillus transformation of podocytes, were observed via electron microscopy in both families. The present study introduces mutations in PTPRO as another cause of autosomal-recessive nephrotic syndrome."}

We report, here, the first total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast/ovarian cancer families for BRCA2 large rearrangements. Deletion of exon 3, which is in phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels of alternative transcripts lacking exon 3 (\u03943 delta3 transcript) have been reported in normal tissues, which raises the question whether deletion of exon 3 is pathogenic.\nLarge BRCA2 rearrangements were analysed by QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments) or MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification). The exon 3 deletion was characterized with a \"zoom-in\" dedicated CGH array to the BRCA2 gene and sequencing. To determine the effect of exon 3 deletion and assess its pathogenic effect, three methods of transcript quantification were used: fragment analysis of FAM-labelled PCR products, specific allelic expression using an intron 2 polymorphism and competitive quantitative RT-PCR.\nLarge rearrangements of BRCA2 were detected in six index cases out of 2058 tested (3% of all deleterious BRCA2 mutations). This study reports the first large rearrangement of the BRCA2 gene that includes all of exon 3 and leads to an in frame deletion of exon 3 at the transcriptional level. Thirty five variants in exon 3 and junction regions of BRCA2 are also reported, that contribute to the interpretation of the pathogenicity of the deletion. The quantitative approaches showed that there are three classes of delta3 BRCA2 transcripts (low, moderate and exclusive). Exclusive expression of the delta3 transcript by the mutant allele and segregation data provide evidence for a causal effect of the exon 3 deletion.\nThis paper highlights that large rearrangements and total deletion of exon 3 in the BRCA2 gene could contribute to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that, to interpret the pathogenic effect of any variants of exon 3, both accurate transcript quantification and co-segregation analysis are required."}

We explain how the model can be applied to public data and provide tables that list the VUS that have been classified as not pathogenic or pathogenic using this method.

Using thermolysin in two proteolytic techniques, we examined conformation of these mutants directly in crude cell extracts after expression in E. coli. Proteolysis with thermolysin under native conditions appeared to be a useful technique even for very unstable mutant proteins, whereas pulse proteolysis in a urea gradient had limited values for the study of the majority of CBS mutants due to their instability. Mutants in the active core had either slightly increased unfolding (p.A114V, p.E302K and p.G307S) or extensive unfolding with decreased stability (p.H65R, p.T191M, p.I278T and p.R369C). The extent of the unfolding inversely correlated with the previously determined degree of tetrameric assembly and with the catalytic activity. In contrast, mutants bearing aminoacid substitutions in the C-terminal regulatory domain (p.R439Q and p.D444N) had increased global stability with decreased flexibility. This study shows that proteolytic techniques can reveal conformational abnormalities even for CBS mutants that have activity and/or a degree of assembly similar to the wild-type enzyme. We present here a methodological strategy that may be used in cell lysates to evaluate properties of proteins that tend to misfold and aggregate and that may be important for conformational studies of disease-causing mutations in the field of inborn errors of metabolism."}

Mutations in GPIHBP1 (n\u2003=\u20033), APOC2 (n\u2003=\u20031) and APOA5 (n\u2003=\u20032) were rare but the associated clinical phenotype was severe. Routine sequencing of candidate genes in severe HTG has improved our understanding of the molecular basis of this phenotype associated with acute pancreatitis and may help to guide future individualized therapeutic strategies."}

We selected participants recruited to the Women's Environment, Cancer, and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study and screened lymphocyte DNA from cases with contralateral breast cancer (n = 559) and matched controls with unilateral breast cancer (n = 565) for PALB2 mutations. Five pathogenic PALB2 mutations were identified among the cases (0.9%) versus none among the controls (P = 0.04). The first-degree female relatives of these five carriers demonstrated significantly higher incidence of breast cancer than relatives of noncarrier cases, indicating that pathogenic PALB2 mutations confer an estimated 5.3-fold increase in risk (95% CI: 1.8-13.2). The frequency of rare (<1% MAF) missense mutations was similar in both groups (23 vs. 21). Our findings confirm in a population-based study setting of women with breast cancer the strong risk associated with truncating mutations in PALB2 that has been reported in family studies. Conversely, there is no evidence from this study that rare PALB2 missense mutations strongly influence breast cancer risk."}

Early detection coupled with dietary modification greatly reduces pathology, but the response to treatment differs with the allele of CBS. A better understanding of the relationship between allelic variants and protein function will improve both diagnosis and treatment. To this end, we tested the function of 84 CBS alleles previously sequenced from patients with homocystinuria by ortholog replacement in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Within this clinically associated set, 15% of variant alleles were indistinguishable from the predominant CBS allele in function, suggesting enzymatic activity was retained. An additional 37% of the alleles were partially functional or could be rescued by cofactor supplementation in the growth medium. This large class included alleles rescued by elevated levels of the cofactor vitamin B6, but also alleles rescued by elevated heme, a second CBS cofactor. Measurement of the metabolite levels in CBS-substituted yeast grown with different B6 levels using LC-MS revealed changes in metabolism that propagated beyond the substrate and product of CBS. Production of the critical antioxidant glutathione through the CBS pathway was greatly decreased when CBS function was restricted through genetic, cofactor, or substrate restriction, a metabolic consequence with implications for treatment."}

Genomic libraries with barcode sequence-tags were pooled (in pools of 8 or 16 samples) and enriched for target DNA sequences. Sequencing was performed on ABI SOLiD-4 platforms. We produced > 12 gigabases of raw sequence data to sequence at high coverage (average: 42X) the 700-kilobase target area in 22 individuals. A total of 1876 high-quality genetic variants were identified (1778 single nucleotide substitutions and 98 insertions/deletions). Annotation on databases of genetic variation and human disease mutations revealed several novel, potentially deleterious mutations. We tested 576 common variants in a case-control association analysis, carrying the top-5 associations over to replication in up to 719 DVT cases and 719 controls. We also conducted an analysis of the burden of nonsynonymous variants in coagulation factor and anticoagulant genes. We found an excess of rare missense mutations in anticoagulant genes in DVT cases compared to controls and an association for a missense polymorphism of FGA (rs6050; p = 1.9 \u00d7 10(-5), OR 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22-1.72; after replication in > 1400 individuals).\nWe implemented a barcode-based strategy to efficiently multiplex sequencing of hundreds of candidate genes in several individuals.

Videomicrocopy was used to examine ciliary motion in nasal tissue, and nasal nitric oxide (nNO) was measured; nNO level is typically low with PCD. Eighteen patients exhibited CD characterized by abnormal ciliary motion and nNO levels below or near the PCD cutoff values. Patients with CD aged >6 years show increased respiratory symptoms similar to those seen in PCD. Sequencing of all 14 known PCD genes in 13 heterotaxy patients with CD, 12 without CD, 10 PCD disease controls, and 13 healthy controls yielded 0.769, 0.417, 1.0, and 0.077 novel variants per patient, respectively. One heterotaxy patient with CD had the PCD causing DNAI1 founder mutation. Another with hyperkinetic ciliary beat had 2 mutations in DNAH11, the only PCD gene known to cause hyperkinetic beat. Among PCD patients, 2 had known PCD causing CCDC39 and CCDC40 mutations.\nOur studies show that CHD patients with heterotaxy have substantial risk for CD and increased respiratory disease.

All these VUSs were analyzed by using six tools (splice site prediction by neural network, splice site finder (SSF), MaxEntScan (MES), ESE finder, relative enhancer and silencer classification by unanimous enrichment, and human splicing finder) and the predictions obtained were compared with transcript analysis results. Combining MES and SSF gave 96% sensitivity and 83% specificity for VUSs occurring in the vicinity of consensus splice sites, that is, the surrounding 11 and 14 bases for the 5' and 3' sites, respectively.

The common p.P20L and p.R229Q polymorphisms of the NPHS2 gene were tested in 169 patients with IgA nephropathy and in 300 individuals of the control group. No mutation in the NPHS2 gene in patients with adult onset was identified. One homozygous mutation p.V290M in a patient with onset in early childhood was found. One new heterozygous variant in the non-conservative area of the NPHS2 gene, p.G97S, was identified in a patient with childhood-onset FSGS. In one adult patient, there were two polymorphisms, p.P20L and p.R229Q, in trans-heterozygous state, which could contribute to steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The most common polymorphism p.R229Q was identified in 12 % of FSGS/ MCD patients, in 11.8 % of IGAN patients and in 10% of controls. The heterozygosity of p.R229Q polymorphism was similar in the IGAN group, with non-significantly higher prevalence in IGAN patients with progressive form of the disease (15.9 % versus 9.4 %). The prevalence of p.P20L polymorphism was not significantly different among the groups (6 % in FSGS patients, 1.8 % in IGAN patients, 1 % in the control group).

There is a paucity of data on the putative contribution of both genes to inherited breast cancer in Jewish high risk families. High risk Jewish women, none of whom was a carrier of the predominant Jewish mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2, were screened for BRIP1 germline mutations by combined denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, high resolution melting and sequencing. Direct sequencing of exons and flanking intronic sequences was used for PALB2 mutational analysis. Overall, 149 women, all of high risk, cancer prone families of Ashkenazi origin, were genotyped for BRIP1 mutations: 127 with breast cancer, 22 with ovarian cancer. No truncating mutations were noted and one novel (p.Ala745Thr) and two previously described missense mutations were detected. For PALB2, 93 women were genotyped (87 with breast cancer) of Ashkenazi (n\u00a0=\u00a032) and non Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Fifteen sequence variants were detected, of these, none was truncating, four were not previously reported, and two (p.Asp871Gly and p.Leu1119Pro) were seemingly pathogenic based on the PolyPhen2 protein prediction algorithm. These missense mutations were not detected in any of 113 healthy Ashkenazi and 109 Moroccan, cancer free controls. In conclusion, germline mutations in BRIP1 and PALB2 contribute marginally to breast cancer susceptibility in ethnically diverse, Jewish high risk families."}

We piloted secondary variant detection by analyzing exomes for mutations in cancer-susceptibility syndromes in subjects ascertained for atherosclerosis phenotypes. We performed exome sequencing on 572 ClinSeq participants, and in 37 genes, we interpreted variants that cause high-penetrance cancer syndromes by using an algorithm that filtered results on the basis of mutation type, quality, and frequency and that filtered mutation-database entries on the basis of defined categories of causation. We identified 454 sequence variants that differed from the human reference. Exclusions were made on the basis of sequence quality (26 variants) and high frequency in the cohort (77 variants) or dbSNP (17 variants), leaving 334 variants of potential clinical importance. These were further filtered on the basis of curation of literature reports. Seven participants, four of whom were of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and three of whom did not meet family-history-based referral criteria, had deleterious BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. One participant had a deleterious SDHC mutation, which causes paragangliomas. Exome sequencing, coupled with multidisciplinary interpretation, detected clinically important mutations in cancer-susceptibility genes; four of such mutations were in individuals without a significant family history of disease. We conclude that secondary variants of high clinical importance will be detected at an appreciable frequency in exomes, and we suggest that priority be given to the development of more efficient modes of interpretation with trials in larger patient groups."}

Here, we identified a new patient with this CD16 mutation and compared the patient's NK cells to those of the originally reported patient. Patients with the L66H mutation had intact ADCC, but deficient spontaneous NK cell cytotoxicity and decreased surface expression of CD2, a coactivation receptor. Mechanistic studies in a human NK cell line, NK-92, demonstrated that CD16 expression correlated with CD2 surface levels and enabled killing of a melanoma cell line typically resistant to CD16-deficient NK-92 cells. An association between CD16 and CD2 was identified biochemically and at the immunological synapse, which elicited CD16 signaling after CD2 engagement. Stable expression of CD16 L66H in NK-92 cells recapitulated the patient phenotype, abrogating association of CD16 with CD2 as well as CD16 signaling after CD2 ligation. Thus, CD16 serves a role in NK cell-mediated spontaneous cytotoxicity through a specific association with CD2 and represents a potential mechanism underlying a human congenital immunodeficiency."}

The frequency of the p.V290M mutation in late-onset SRNS was examined in the French and PodoNet cohorts.\nOf the 38 Hungarian patients screened, seven carried NPHS2 mutations on both alleles, of whom two-diagnosed with proteinuria through school screening programs at the age of 9.7 and 14\u00a0years, respectively-did not develop nephrotic syndrome in childhood. The first, an 18-year-old boy, homozygous for p.V290M, has never developed edema. The second, a 31-year-old woman-compound heterozygous for p.V290M and p.R138Q-was first detected with hypoalbuminemia (<30\u00a0g/l) and edema at the age of 24.3 and 27.5\u00a0years, respectively. Both patients currently have a normal glomerular filtration rate. The mutation p.V290M was carried by three of the 38 patients in the Hungarian cohort, by two of the 95 patients with late-onset SRNS in the PodoNet cohort and by none of the 83 patients in the French cohort.\nWe propose that not only the p.R229Q variant, but also the p.V290M mutation should be screened in Central and Eastern European patients with late-onset SRNS."}

The aim of this study was to develop an NGS-based workflow for routine diagnostics for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOCS), to improve genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. A NGS-based workflow was designed using BRCA MASTR kit amplicon libraries followed by GS Junior pyrosequencing. Data analysis combined Variant Identification Pipeline freely available software and ad hoc R scripts, including a cascade of filters to generate coverage and variant calling reports. A BRCA homopolymer assay was performed in parallel. A research scheme was designed in two parts. A Training Set of 28 DNA samples containing 23 unique pathogenic mutations and 213 other variants (33 unique) was used. The workflow was validated in a set of 14 samples from HBOCS families in parallel with the current diagnostic workflow (Validation Set). The NGS-based workflow developed permitted the identification of all pathogenic mutations and genetic variants, including those located in or close to homopolymers. The use of NGS for detecting copy-number alterations was also investigated. The workflow meets the sensitivity and specificity requirements for the genetic diagnosis of HBOCS and improves on the cost-effectiveness of current approaches."}

In this study, we addressed this issue by deep exon sequencing and large-scale genotyping of 25 biological candidate genes located within RA risk loci discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs). First, we assessed the contribution of rare coding variants in the 25 genes to the risk of RA in a pooled sequencing study of 500 RA cases and 650 controls of European ancestry. We observed an accumulation of rare nonsynonymous variants exclusive to RA cases in IL2RA and IL2RB (burden test: p = 0.007 and p = 0.018, respectively). Next, we assessed the aggregate contribution of low-frequency and common coding variants to the risk of RA by dense genotyping of the 25 gene loci in 10,609 RA cases and 35,605 controls. We observed a strong enrichment of coding variants with a nominal signal of association with RA (p < 0.05) after adjusting for the best signal of association at the loci (p(enrichment) = 6.4 \u00d7 10(-4)). For one locus containing CD2, we found that a missense variant, rs699738 (c.798C>A [p.His266Gln]), and a noncoding variant, rs624988, reside on distinct haplotypes and independently contribute to the risk of RA (p = 4.6 \u00d7 10(-6)). Overall, our results indicate that variants (distributed across the allele-frequency spectrum) within the protein-coding portion of a subset of biological candidate genes identified by GWASs contribute to the risk of RA. Further, we have demonstrated that very large sample sizes will be required for comprehensively identifying the independent alleles contributing to the missing heritability of RA."}

Recognition of MAS in patients with SLE may be particularly challenging because it may mimic the clinical features of the underlying disease or be confused with an infectious complication. Massive hypercytokinemia is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus-associated macrophage activation syndrome (SLE-MAS) but the pathogenesis and kinetics of cytokine release in SLE-MAS patients is not well studied. We present a case of SLE-MAS. The patient showed the distinct cytokine profile of SLE-MAS compared to systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated MAS and Epstein-Barr virus-induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. The observed TNF-\u03b1 dominant increase appears to be characteristic of SLE-MAS. IgM type antilymphocyte antibody (ALAB) was detected on the surface of lymphocytes during the acute phase and disappeared when the patient was in remission. The patient had a heterozygous P369S-R408Q mutation in the MEFV gene. Our results suggest that ALAB and a MEFV mutation might play important roles in the pathogenesis of SLE-MAS. Furthermore, the cytokine profile of SLE-MAS differs from that of S-JIA-MAS: the TNF-\u03b1 dominant increase appears to be characteristic."}

The hypothesis was that the increasing reliability of next generation sequencing allows comprehensive one-step genetic investigation of this group and similar patient groups.\nThis study used next generation sequencing to screen 446 genes, including the 24 genes known to be associated with hereditary steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The first 36 pediatric patients collected through a national United Kingdom Renal Registry were chosen with comprehensive phenotypic detail. Significant variants detected by next generation sequencing were confirmed by conventional Sanger sequencing.\nAnalysis revealed known and novel disease-associated variations in expected genes such as NPHS1, NPHS2, and PLCe1 in 19% of patients. Phenotypically unexpected mutations were also detected in COQ2 and COL4A4 in two patients with isolated nephropathy and associated sensorineural deafness, respectively. The presence of an additional heterozygous polymorphism in WT1 in a patient with NPHS1 mutation was associated with earlier-onset disease, supporting modification of phenotype through genetic epistasis.\nThis study shows that next generation sequencing analysis of pediatric steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome patients is accurate and revealing. This analysis should be considered part of the routine genetic workup of diseases such as childhood steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, where the chance of genetic mutation is high but requires sequencing of multiple genes."}

As this risk is of clinical relevance, we sought to identify mono-allelic PALB2 mutations and determine their frequencies in multiple-case breast cancer families attending Familial Cancer Clinics in Australia and New Zealand.\nThe youngest affected woman, not known to carry a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, from 747 multiple-case breast cancer families participating in kConFab were selected for PALB2 mutation screening. The coding and flanking intronic regions of PALB2 in DNA extracted from blood were screened using high-resolution melt curve analysis with Sanger sequencing confirmation. Where possible, relatives of women found to carry PALB2 mutations were genotyped for the family-specific mutation, mutant transcripts were characterised and breast tumours arising in mutation carriers were recalled and reviewed. Missense mutations were assessed for potential to disrupt protein function via SIFT, Align GVGD and Polyphen-2.\nThe mutation screen identified two nonsense mutations (PALB2 c.3113G>A in eight women and PALB2 c.196C>T in one woman), two frameshift mutations (PALB2 c.1947_1948insA and PALB2 c.2982_2983insT each in one woman), 10 missense variants, eight synonymous variants and four variants in intronic regions. Of the four PALB2 mutations identified that were predicted to produce truncated protein products, only PALB2 c.1947_1948insA had not previously been reported. PALB2 c.3113G>A and PALB2 c.196C>T were previously identified in the Australian population whereas PALB2 c.2982_2983insT was previously reported in the UK population. Transcripts derived from three of these mutant PALB2 alleles were vulnerable to nonsense-mediated decay. One missense mutation (PALB2 c.2993G>A) was predicted to disrupt protein function via the three in silico assessment methods applied. The majority of breast cancers arising in carriers that were available for review were high-grade invasive ductal carcinomas.\nAbout 1.5% (95% CI 0.6to 2.4) of Australasian multiple-case breast cancer families attending clinics are segregating protein-truncating mutations in PALB2, most being PALB2 c.3113G>A, p.Trp1038*.

Germline screening of the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 (c.1100delC) and TP53 genes was performed in 54 unrelated patients <35 y; their tumors were investigated with respect to transcriptional and genomic profiles as well as hormonal receptors and HER2 expression/amplification. Germline mutations were detected in 12 out of 54 patients (22%) [7 in BRCA1 (13%), 4 in BRCA2 (7%) and one in TP53 (2%) gene]. A cancer familial history was present in 31.4% of the unrelated patients, from them 43.7% were carriers for germline mutation (37.5% in BRCA1 and in 6.2% in the BRCA2 genes). Fifty percent of the unrelated patients with hormone receptor-negative tumors carried BRCA1 mutations, percentage increasing to 83% in cases with familial history of cancer. Over-representation of DNA damage-, cellular and cell cycle-related processes was detected in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-associated tumors, whereas cell and embryo development-related processes were over-represented in the up-regulated genes of BRCA1/2-negative tumors, suggesting distinct mechanisms driving the tumorigenesis. An initial portrait of the early-onset breast cancer patients in Brazil was generated pointing out that hormone receptor-negative tumors and positive familial history are two major risk factors for detection of a BRCA1 germline mutation. Additionally, the data revealed molecular factors that potentially trigger the tumor development in young patients."}

Of these, 21% had a positive family history. Autosomal dominant cases were screened for WT1, TRPC6, ACTN4, and INF2 mutations. All other patients had the NPHS2 gene screened, and WT1 was tested in sporadic cases. In addition, 40 sporadic cases had the entire coding region of INF2 tested. Of the autosomal recessive and the sporadic cases, 13 and 6%, respectively, were found to have podocin-associated nephrotic syndrome, and 56% of them were compound heterozygous for the nonneutral p.R229Q polymorphism. Four percent of the sporadic and 10% of the autosomal dominant cases had a mutation in WT1. Pathogenic INF2 mutations were found in 20% of the dominant but none of the sporadic cases. In a large cohort of adolescents including both familial and sporadic disease, NPHS2 mutations explained about 7% and WT1 4% of cases, whereas INF2 proved relevant only in autosomal dominant familial disease. Thus, screening of the entire coding sequence of NPHS2 and exons 8-9 of WT1 appears to be the most rational and cost-effective screening approach in sporadic juvenile steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome."}

Sixty-one patients (17.4%) carried at least 1 detected mutation in 1 of the 3 tested genes (34 CFTR, 10 PRSS1 and 13 SPINK1 mutations), and 4 patients showed a combination of mutations. Follow-up has been currently extended to a median of 5 years (range 1-40). Similar clinical features were noted in the case and matched groups except for an earlier age of onset of pancreatic symptoms and a higher incidence of pancreatic cancer in the case group and in patients with CFTR mutations compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The standardized incidence ratio, the ratio of observed to expected pancreatic cancers, averaged 26.5 (95% confidence interval 8.6-61.9). All pancreatic cancer patients were smokers.\nClinical parameters of patients with sporadic idiopathic pancreatitis and gene mutations are similar to those of age- and sex-matched patients without gene mutations, except for the age of pancreatic disease onset. A significantly higher occurrence of pancreas cancer was observed in the case group, particularly in those patients carrying CFTR mutations. We therefore suggest to include patients with CFTR variants presenting with risk factors in a screening and surveillance programme and to strongly advise them to stop smoking."}

Knockdown of Hif1an in Xenopus results in a phenotype that resembles loss of other NPHP proteins.

PALB2 has been shown to be a moderate-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility gene and is involved in the same DNA damage repair pathway as BRCA1 and BRCA2; this raises the possibility that germline PALB2 mutations may be involved in the pathogenesis of TNBCs. In our study, we sequenced the coding regions of PALB2 (including intron/exon boundaries) in genomic DNA from 347 patients diagnosed with TNBC to determine the prevalence of deleterious mutations in this population.

A major controversy has developed surrounding the return of secondary results to research participants. We have piloted a method to analyze exomes to identify participants at risk for cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, or sudden death.\nExome sequencing was performed on 870 participants not selected for arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, or a family history of sudden death. Exome data from 22 cardiac arrhythmia- and 41 cardiomyopathy-associated genes were analyzed using an algorithm that filtered results on genotype quality, frequency, and database information. We identified 1367 variants in the cardiomyopathy genes and 360 variants in the arrhythmia genes. Six participants had pathogenic variants associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (n=1), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=2), left ventricular noncompaction (n=1), or long-QT syndrome (n=2). Two of these participants had evidence of cardiomyopathy and 1 had left ventricular noncompaction on echocardiogram. Three participants with likely pathogenic variants had prolonged QTc. Family history included unexplained sudden death among relatives.\nApproximately 0.5% of participants in this study had pathogenic variants in known cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia genes. This high frequency may be due to self-selection, false positives, or underestimation of the prevalence of these conditions. We conclude that clinically important cardiomyopathy and dysrhythmia secondary variants can be identified in unselected exomes."}

We show that ZMYND10 and LRRC6 interact and that certain ZMYND10 and LRRC6 mutations abrogate the interaction between the LRRC6 CS domain and the ZMYND10 C-terminal domain. Additionally, ZMYND10 and LRRC6 colocalize with the centriole markers SAS6 and PCM1. Mutations in ZMYND10 result in the absence of the axonemal protein components DNAH5 and DNALI1 from respiratory cilia. Animal models support the association between ZMYND10 and human PCD, given that zmynd10 knockdown in zebrafish caused ciliary paralysis leading to cystic kidneys and otolith defects and that knockdown in Xenopus interfered with ciliogenesis. Our findings suggest that a cytoplasmic protein complex containing ZMYND10 and LRRC6 is necessary for motile ciliary function."}

Using whole-exome and candidate-gene Sanger resequencing in PCD-affected families afflicted with combined IDA and ODA defects, we found that 6/38 (16%) carried biallelic mutations in the conserved zinc-finger gene BLU (ZMYND10). ZMYND10 mutations conferred dynein-arm loss seen at the ultrastructural and immunofluorescence level and complete cilia immotility, except in hypomorphic p.Val16Gly (c.47T>G) homozygote individuals, whose cilia retained a stiff and slowed beat. In mice, Zmynd10 mRNA is restricted to regions containing motile cilia. In a Drosophila model of PCD, Zmynd10 is exclusively expressed in cells with motile cilia: chordotonal sensory neurons and sperm. In these cells, P-element-mediated gene silencing caused IDA and ODA defects, proprioception deficits, and sterility due to immotile sperm. Drosophila Zmynd10 with an equivalent c.47T>G (p.Val16Gly) missense change rescued mutant male sterility less than the wild-type did. Tagged Drosophila ZMYND10 is localized primarily to the cytoplasm, and human ZMYND10 interacts with LRRC6, another cytoplasmically localized protein altered in PCD. Using a fly model of PCD, we conclude that ZMYND10 is a cytoplasmic protein required for IDA and ODA assembly and that its variants cause ciliary dysmotility and PCD with laterality defects."}

A total of 100 samples were selected, and their MEFV gene exons and intron junctions were completely sequenced.\nWe observed that in children severe phenotypes with polyserositis, erysipelas-like erythema, splenomegaly, and vasculitis are associated with high penetrance of exon 10 mutations, particularly M694V. Several forms of arthritis were associated with familial Mediterranean fever, including acute mono/oligoarthritis in the lower extremities, destructive arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, arthritis of the hip joint, and juvenile chronic arthritis. Severe life-threatening complications, such as adhesive intestinal obstruction, renal amyloidosis, and uncommon/rare symptoms were sometimes the only form of familial Mediterranean fever manifestation.\nWe suggest performing familial Mediterranean fever genetic testing for patients presenting with rare/uncommon symptoms also common in other disorders, to prevent misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. In our experience, the most effective patient management for familial Mediterranean fever was its rapid diagnosis through genetic testing, initiation of colchicine therapy, and promotion of attack prevention through counseling."}

Often these effects are difficult to predict and are only detected by performing RNA analyses. Here, we analyzed, in a minigene assay, 26 variants identified in the exon\u00a07 of BRCA2, a cancer predisposition gene. Our results revealed eight new exon skipping mutations in this exon: one directly altering the 5' splice site and seven affecting potential regulatory elements. This brings the number of splicing regulatory mutations detected in BRCA2 exon\u00a07 to a total of 11, a remarkably high number considering the total number of variants reported in this exon (n\u00a0=\u00a036), all tested in our minigene assay. We then exploited this large set of splicing data to test the predictive value of splicing regulator hexamers' scores recently established by Ke et al. (). Comparisons of hexamer-based predictions with our experimental data revealed high sensitivity in detecting variants that increased exon skipping, an important feature for prescreening variants before RNA analysis. In conclusion, hexamer scores represent a promising tool for predicting the biological consequences of exonic variants and may have important applications for the interpretation of variants detected by high-throughput sequencing."}

Myocardial infarction is the most severe outcome of CAD. Despite extensive efforts, the genetics of CAD is poorly understood. We aimed to identify the genetic cause of CAD in a pedigree with several affected individuals. Exome sequencing led to identification of a mutation in CYP27A1 that causes p.Arg225His in the encoded protein sterol 27-hydroxylase as the likely cause of CAD in the pedigree. The enzyme is multifunctional, and several of its functions including its functions in vitamin D metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) are relevant to the CAD phenotype. Measurements of vitamin D levels suggested that the mutation does not affect CAD by affecting this parameter. We suggest that the mutation may cause CAD by affecting RCT. Screening of all coding regions of the CYP27A1 in 100 additional patients led to finding four variations (p.Arg14Gly, p.Arg26Lys, p.Ala27Arg, and p.Val86Met) in seven patients that may contribute to their CAD status. CYP27A1 is the known causative gene of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, a disorder which is sometimes accompanied by early onset atherosclerosis. This and the observation of potentially harmful variations in unrelated CAD patients provide additional evidence for the suggested causative role of the p.Arg225His mutation in CAD."}

We performed whole exome sequencing (WES) on 81 volunteers, and for each volunteer, we requested personal medical histories, constructed a three-generation pedigree, and required their participation in a comprehensive educational program. We limited our clinical reporting to disease risks based on only rare damaging mutations and known pathogenic variations in genes previously reported to be associated with human disorders. We identified 271 recessive risk alleles (214 genes), 126 dominant risk alleles (101 genes), and 3 X-recessive risk alleles (3 genes). We linked personal disease histories with causative disease genes in 18 volunteers. Furthermore, by incorporating family histories into our genetic analyses, we identified an additional five heritable diseases. Traditional genetic counseling and disease education were provided in verbal and written reports to all volunteers. Our report demonstrates that when genome results are carefully interpreted and integrated with an individual's medical records and pedigree data, NGS is a valuable diagnostic tool for genetic disease risk."}

As a result, 61 mutations were identified in 45 probands, including 38 novel pathogenic alleles. Interestingly, we observed that phenotype and genotype were not in full agreement in 21 probands. Among them, eight probands were clinically reassessed, resulting in refinement of clinical diagnoses for six of these patients. Finally, recessive mutations in CLN3 were identified in five retinal degeneration patients, including four RP probands and one cone-rod dystrophy patient, suggesting that CLN3 is a novel non-syndromic retinal disease gene. Collectively, our results underscore that, due to the high molecular and clinical heterogeneity of RP, comprehensive screening of all retinal disease genes is effective in identifying novel pathogenic mutations and provides an opportunity to discover new genotype-phenotype correlations.

The study of AGT has important implications for protein folding and trafficking because PH1 mutants may cause protein aggregation and mitochondrial mistargeting. We herein describe a multidisciplinary study aimed to understand the molecular basis of protein aggregation and mistargeting in PH1 by studying twelve AGT variants. Expression studies in cell cultures reveal strong protein folding defects in PH1 causing mutants leading to enhanced aggregation, and in two cases, mitochondrial mistargeting. Immunoprecipitation studies in a cell-free system reveal that most mutants enhance the interactions with Hsc70 chaperones along their folding process, while in vitro binding experiments show no changes in the interaction of folded AGT dimers with the peroxisomal receptor Pex5p. Thermal denaturation studies by calorimetry support that PH1 causing mutants often kinetically destabilize the folded apo-protein through significant changes in the denaturation free energy barrier, whereas coenzyme binding overcomes this destabilization. Modeling of the mutations on a 1.9 \u00c5 crystal structure suggests that PH1 causing mutants perturb locally the native structure. Our work support that a misbalance between denaturation energetics and interactions with chaperones underlie aggregation and mistargeting in PH1, suggesting that native state stabilizers and protein homeostasis modulators are potential drugs to restore the complex and delicate balance of AGT protein homeostasis in PH1."}

We show that, contrary to expectations, this allele leads to a disease phenotype only when it is associated specifically with certain 3' NPHS2 mutations because of an altered heterodimerization and mislocalization of the encoded p.Arg229Gln podocin. The disease-associated 3' mutations exert a dominant-negative effect on p.Arg229Gln podocin but behave as recessive alleles when associated with wild-type podocin. Therefore, the transmission rates for couples carrying the disease-associated mutations and p.Arg229Gln may be substantially different from those expected in autosomal-recessive disorders."}

After the combined analysis, we were able to classify 4 splicing variants as pathogenic mutations, 16 variants as neutral, and 3 variants as polymorphisms; only 2 variants remained classified as VUS. This work highlights the contribution of DNA, RNA, and in silico data to assess the pathogenicity of BRCA1/2 VUS, which, in turn, allows more accurate genetic counseling and clinical management of the families carrying them."}

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of the published data to investigate the impact of the p.R229Q polymorphism on FSGS and SRNS patients. Despite significant heterogeneity within some of the comparisons, the results revealed significantly higher risks of SRNS in individuals homozygous for the variant allele (OR 7.411, 95% confidence interval 1.876-29.436, p = 0.004) compared to homozygous non-variant individuals. However, the carrier rate of the p.R229Q variant was not significantly different between SRNS patients and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome patients. No statistically significant differences in the p.R229Q carrier rate were observed between FSGS patients and controls or FSGS patients and patients with different pathology classifications. No notable differences in the p.R229Q carrier rate were found between patients and controls in any group with early-onset disease (onset age < 18). In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that for adult-onset disease (onset age > 18), the homozygous variant could be a potential predictor of hereditary nephrotic syndrome and that the p.R229Q allele cannot currently be considered a risk factor for predicting FSGS."}

One of the hurdles to clinical implementation is the high number of variants of unknown significance. For cancer-susceptibility genes, the difficulty in interpreting the clinical relevance of the genomic variants is compounded by the fact that most of what is known about these variants comes from the study of highly selected populations, such as cancer patients or individuals with a family history of cancer. The genetic variation in known cancer-susceptibility genes in the general population has not been well characterized to date. To address this gap, we profiled the nonsynonymous genomic variation in 158 genes causally implicated in carcinogenesis using high-quality whole genome sequences from an ancestrally diverse cohort of 681 healthy individuals. We found that all individuals carry multiple variants that may impact cancer susceptibility, with an average of 68 variants per individual. Of the 2,688 allelic variants identified within the cohort, most are very rare, with 75% found in only 1 or 2 individuals in our population. Allele frequencies vary between ancestral groups, and there are 21 variants for which the minor allele in one population is the major allele in another. Detailed analysis of a selected subset of 5 clinically important cancer genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, KRAS, TP53, and PTEN, highlights differences between germline variants and reported somatic mutations. The dataset can serve a resource of genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in 6 ancestry groups, an important foundation for the interpretation of cancer risk from personal genome sequences."}

Emerging evidence indicates that abnormal cardiovascular development is involved in the pathogenesis of AF. In this study, the coding exons and splice sites of the NKX2-5 gene, which encodes a homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for cardiovascular genesis, were sequenced in 146 unrelated patients with lone AF as well as the available relatives of the mutation carriers. A total of 700 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were genotyped. The disease-causing potential of the identified NKX2-5 variations was predicted by MutationTaster and PolyPhen-2. The functional characteristics of the mutant NKX2-5 proteins were analyzed using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. As a result, two heterozygous NKX2-5 mutations, including a previously reported p.E21Q and a novel p.T180A mutation, were identified in two families with AF transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern. The mutations co-segregated with AF in the families with complete penetrance. The detected substitutions, which altered the amino acids highly conserved evolutionarily across species, were absent in 700 control individuals and were both predicted to be causative. Functional analyses demonstrated that the NKX2-5 mutants were associated with significantly decreased transcriptional activity compared with their wild-type counterpart. The findings expand the spectrum of NKX2-5 mutations linked to AF and provide additional evidence that dysfunctional NKX2-5 may confer vulnerability to AF, suggesting the potential benefit for the early prophylaxis and personalized treatment of AF."}

In Japan, patients with FMF have been previously reported, including a mild or incomplete form. Several factors are presumed to contribute to the variable penetrance and to the phenotypic variability of FMF. We conducted the current study to investigate the correlation of variable clinical presentations and MEFV genotypic distributions in Japanese FMF patients.We analyzed demographic, clinical, and genetic data for 311 FMF patients enrolled in the study. Clinically, we classified FMF into 2 phenotypes: 1) the \"typical\" form of FMF, and 2) the \"atypical\" form of FMF according to the Tel Hashomer criteria. Patients with the typical FMF phenotype had a higher frequency of febrile episodes, a shorter duration of febrile attacks, more frequent thoracic pain, abdominal pain, a family history of FMF, and MEFV exon 10 mutations. Conversely, patients with the atypical FMF phenotype had a lower frequency of fever episodes and more frequent arthritis in atypical distribution, myalgia, and MEFV exon 3 mutations. Multivariate analysis showed that the variable associated with typical FMF presentation was the presence of MEFV exon 10 mutations. Typical FMF phenotype frequencies were decreased in patients carrying 2 or a single low-penetrance mutations compared with those carrying 2 or a single high-penetrance mutations (M694I), with an opposite trend for the atypical FMF phenotype. In addition, patients having more than 2 MEFV mutations had a younger disease onset and a higher prevalence of thoracic pain than those carrying a single or no mutations. Thus, MEFV exon 10 mutations are associated with the more typical FMF phenotype. In contrast, more than half of the Japanese FMF patients without MEFV exon 10 mutations presented with an atypical FMF phenotype, indicating that Japanese FMF patients tend to be divided into 2 phenotypes by a variation of MEFV mutations."}

BRCA1 pathogenic mutations were found in 20 cases, including two cases with CNVs, whereas BRCA2 mutations were found in 7 cases. We also found three patients with the TP53 R337H mutation and one patient with the CHEK2 1100delC mutation. Seven (25%) pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2 were firstly described, including a splice-site BRCA1 mutation for which pathogenicity was confirmed by the presence of an aberrant transcript showing the loss of the last 62 bp of exon 7.

Moreover, the detection of the TP53 R337H variant in our series and the fact that this variant has a founder effect in our population prompted us to suggest that all female breast cancer patients with clinical criteria for HBOC and negative for BRCA1/2 genes should be tested for the TP53 R337H variant. Furthermore, the presence of genomic structural rearrangement resulting in CNVs in other genes that predispose breast cancer in conjunction with BRCA2 point mutations demonstrated a highly complex genetic etiology in Brazilian breast cancer families."}

Although BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations have been reported to commonly lead to alterations in genes that encode cancer-related proteins, little is known regarding the putative impact of these mutations on noncoding miRNAs. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether miRNA dysregulation is involved in the pathogenesis of BRCA-mutated BC.

Intracellular WNK1-SPAK activation causes CFTR to change permeability and conductance characteristics from a chloride-preferring to bicarbonate-preferring channel through unknown mechanisms. Two severe CFTR mutations (CFTRsev) cause complete loss of CFTR function and result in cystic fibrosis (CF), a severe genetic disorder affecting sweat glands, nasal sinuses, lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, and male reproductive system. We hypothesize that those CFTR mutations that disrupt the WNK1-SPAK activation mechanisms cause a selective, bicarbonate defect in channel function (CFTRBD) affecting organs that utilize CFTR for bicarbonate secretion (e.g. the pancreas, nasal sinus, vas deferens) but do not cause typical CF. To understand the structural and functional requirements of the CFTR bicarbonate-preferring channel, we (a) screened 984 well-phenotyped pancreatitis cases for candidate CFTRBD mutations from among 81 previously described CFTR variants; (b) conducted electrophysiology studies on clones of variants found in pancreatitis but not CF; (c) computationally constructed a new, complete structural model of CFTR for molecular dynamics simulation of wild-type and mutant variants; and (d) tested the newly defined CFTRBD variants for disease in non-pancreas organs utilizing CFTR for bicarbonate secretion. Nine variants (CFTR R74Q, R75Q, R117H, R170H, L967S, L997F, D1152H, S1235R, and D1270N) not associated with typical CF were associated with pancreatitis (OR 1.5, p\u200a=\u200a0.002). Clones expressed in HEK 293T cells had normal chloride but not bicarbonate permeability and conductance with WNK1-SPAK activation. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest physical restriction of the CFTR channel and altered dynamic channel regulation.

WNK1-SPAK pathway-activated increases in CFTR bicarbonate permeability are altered by CFTRBD variants through multiple mechanisms.

We characterized the frequencies of pathogenic alleles in genes underlying Mendelian conditions commonly assessed by newborn-screening (NBS, n = 39) programs, genes associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD, n = 17), and genes known to influence drug response (PGx, n = 14).

The carrier burden for severe recessive childhood disorders was 0.57. Our results demonstrate that risk alleles of potential clinical utility for both Mendelian and complex traits are detectable in every individual.

MAFs ranged as high as 0.72, a level incompatible with pathogenicity for a fully penetrant disease like NSHL.

Using these thresholds, we recategorized 93 (4.2%) of reported pathogenic variants as benign. Our data show that evaluation of reported pathogenic deafness variants using variant MAFs from multiple distinct ethnicities and sequenced by orthogonal methods provides a powerful filter for determining pathogenicity. The proposed MAF thresholds will facilitate clinical interpretation of variants identified in genetic testing for NSHL.

Mol. Genet.: 24(7), 1908-17.", "abstract": "Predicting the impact of genetic variation on human health remains an important and difficult challenge. Often, algorithmic classifiers are tasked with predicting binary traits (e.g. positive or negative for a disease) from missense variation. Though useful, this arrangement is limiting and contrived, because human diseases often comprise a spectrum of severities, rather than a discrete partitioning of patient populations. Furthermore, labeling variants as causal or benign can be error prone, which is problematic for training supervised learning algorithms (the so-called garbage in, garbage out phenomenon). We explore the potential value of training classifiers using continuous-valued quantitative measurements, rather than binary traits. Using 20 variants from cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) nucleotide-binding domains and six quantitative measures of cystic fibrosis (CF) severity, we trained classifiers to predict CF severity from CFTR variants. Employing cross validation, classifier prediction and measured clinical/functional values were significantly correlated for four of six quantitative traits (correlation P-values from 1.35 \u00d7 10(-4) to 4.15 \u00d7 10(-3)). Classifiers were also able to stratify variants by three clinically relevant risk categories with 85-100% accuracy, depending on which of the six quantitative traits was used for training. Finally, we characterized 11 additional CFTR variants using clinical sweat chloride testing, two functional assays, or all three diagnostics, and validated our classifier using blind prediction.

Furthermore, CRELD1 mutations have not yet been studied in Mexican DS patients with atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD). Mexican DS patients (n = 148) with standard trisomy 21 were classified as follows: group I, normal heart; group II, VSD, ASDII, or both; and group III, AVSD. Mexican healthy controls (n = 113) were also included. Sequence analysis was performed on NKX2-5 and GATA4 in all three groups, and on CRELD1 in only group III. Statistical differences in the percentages of functional variants were analyzed by Fisher's exact test. Three non-synonymous variants in NKX2-5 were identified in the heterozygous state: a novel p.Pro5Ser was found in one DS patient without CHD; the p.Glu21Gln was found in one ASDII patient; and the p.Arg25Cys (R25C) was found in three patients (one from each DS study group). The p.Glu21Gln and R25C were also documented in 0.88 % of the controls. No significant difference was observed between the DS groups and healthy controls. Germline mutations in the NKX2-5, GATA4, and CRELD1 genes do not appear to be associated with CHD in Mexican DS patients. Our findings also support the notion that the R25C variant of NKX2-5 is a polymorphism, as it was not significantly different between our DS patients and controls."}

Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing. Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and should enable new discoveries in precision medicine."}

In order to investigate the criteria and processes for assigning the pathogenicity of specific variants and to estimate the frequency of such incidental findings in patients of European and African ancestry, we classified potentially actionable pathogenic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in all 4300 European- and 2203 African-ancestry participants sequenced by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP). We considered 112 gene-disease pairs selected by an expert panel as associated with medically actionable genetic disorders that may be undiagnosed in adults. The resulting classifications were compared to classifications from other clinical and research genetic testing laboratories, as well as with in silico pathogenicity scores. Among European-ancestry participants, 30 of 4300 (0.7%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.1%) had a disruptive variant that was expected to be pathogenic, whereas 52 (1.2%) had likely pathogenic SNVs. For African-ancestry participants, six of 2203 (0.3%) had a pathogenic SNV and six (0.3%) had an expected pathogenic disruptive variant, whereas 13 (0.6%) had likely pathogenic SNVs.

We report an Arabic girl presenting since the age of 8-years with two patterns of recurrent episodes of fever, and associated with a spectrum of clinical features suggestive of overlap between familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and HIDS. Her 19-year old brother presented since the age of 1 year with prolonged episodes of fever and was diagnosed with HIDS at the age of 7 years based on clinical features and homozygosity for p.V377I mutation in MVK. Shorter episodes of fever and abdominal pain more consistent with FMF ensued since the age of 17 years. Genetic testing done for both patients and all other family members revealed simultaneous presence of mutations in MEFV and MVK but with a variable clinical spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to severe manifestations. Both of our patients are homozygous for p.V377I MVK mutation; the girl is a compound heterozygote for p.E148Q/p.P369S/p.R408G and p.E167D/p.F479L MEFV mutations whereas the brother is a compound heterozygote for p.E148Q/p.P369S/p.R408G and p.M680I MEFV mutations. The clinical implications of having more than one mutation in different genes of monogenic autoinflammatory diseases in the same individual are not clear but may explain atypical clinical manifestations such as the overlap features of both FMF and HIDS in this family."}

By adopting and leveraging next-generation sequencing, clinical laboratories are now performing an ever-increasing catalogue of genetic testing spanning genotyping, single genes, gene panels, exomes, genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenetic assays for genetic disorders. By virtue of increased complexity, this shift in genetic testing has been accompanied by new challenges in sequence interpretation. In this context the ACMG convened a workgroup in 2013 comprising representatives from the ACMG, the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP), and the College of American Pathologists to revisit and revise the standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequence variants. The group consisted of clinical laboratory directors and clinicians. This report represents expert opinion of the workgroup with input from ACMG, AMP, and College of American Pathologists stakeholders. These recommendations primarily apply to the breadth of genetic tests used in clinical laboratories, including genotyping, single genes, panels, exomes, and genomes. This report recommends the use of specific standard terminology-\"pathogenic,\" \"likely pathogenic,\" \"uncertain significance,\" \"likely benign,\" and \"benign\"-to describe variants identified in genes that cause Mendelian disorders. Moreover, this recommendation describes a process for classifying variants into these five categories based on criteria using typical types of variant evidence (e.g., population data, computational data, functional data, segregation data). Because of the increased complexity of analysis and interpretation of clinical genetic testing described in this report, the ACMG strongly recommends that clinical molecular genetic testing should be performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory, with results interpreted by a board-certified clinical molecular geneticist or molecular genetic pathologist or the equivalent."}

Locus-specific variant databases (LSDBs) have been established for numerous disease-associated genes as a research tool for the interpretation of genetic sequence variants to facilitate variant interpretation via aggregated data. If LSDBs are to be used for clinical practice, consistent and transparent criteria regarding the deposition and interpretation of variants are vital, as variant classifications are often used to make important and irreversible clinical decisions. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of 2017 consecutive BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic variants identified from 24,650 consecutive patient samples referred to our laboratory to establish an unbiased dataset representative of the types of variants seen in the US patient population, submitted by clinicians and researchers for BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing. We compared the clinical classifications of these variants among five publicly accessible BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant databases: BIC, ClinVar, HGMD (paid version), LOVD, and the UMD databases. Our results show substantial disparity of variant classifications among publicly accessible databases. Furthermore, it appears that discrepant classifications are not the result of a single outlier but widespread disagreement among databases. This study also shows that databases sometimes favor a clinical classification when current best practice guidelines (ACMG/AMP/CAP) would suggest an uncertain classification. Although LSDBs have been well established for research applications, our results suggest several challenges preclude their wider use in clinical practice."}

(CFTR), is located in nucleotide binding domain (NBD1), disease-causing mutations also occur in NBD2. To provide information on potential therapeutic strategies for mutations in NBD2, we studied, using a combination of biochemical approaches and newly created cell lines, two disease-causing NBD2 mutants, N1303K and S1235R. Surprisingly, neither was rescued by low temperature. Inhibition of proteasomes with MG132 or aggresomes with tubacin rescued the immature B and mature C bands of N1303K and S1235R, indicating that degradation occurs via proteasomes and aggresomes. We found no effect of the lysosome inhibitor E64. Thus, our results show that these NBD2 mutants are processing mutants with unique characteristics. Several known correctors developed to rescue \u0394F508-CFTR, when applied either alone or in combination, significantly increased the maturation of bands B and C of both NBD 2 mutants. The best correction occurred with the combinations of C4 plus C18 or C3 plus C4. Co-transfection of truncated CFTR (\u220627-264) into stably transfected cells was also able to rescue them. This demonstrates for the first time that transcomplementation with a truncated version of CFTR can rescue NBD2 mutants. Our results show that the N1303K mutation has a more profound effect on NBD2 processing than S1235R and that small-molecule correctors increase the maturation of bands B and C in NBD2 mutants. In addition, \u220627-264 was able to transcomplement both NDB2 mutants. We conclude that differences and similarities occur in the impact of mutations on NBD2 when compared to \u0394F508-CFTR suggesting that individualized strategies may be needed to restore their function. Finally our results are important because they suggest that gene or corrector molecule therapies either alone or in combination individualized for NBD2 mutants may be beneficial for patients bearing N1303K or S1235R mutations."}

Recent studies indicate that germline mutations in PALB2 predispose individuals to a high risk of developing familial breast cancer. Therefore, comprehensive identification of PALB2 germline mutations is potentially important for understanding their roles in tumorigenesis and for testing their potential utility as clinical targets. Most of the previous studies of PALB2 have focused on familial breast cancer cases with normal/wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCAx). We hypothesize that PALB2 genetic mutations also exist in individuals with BRCA mutations (BRCA+). To test this hypothesis, PALB2 germline mutations were screened in 107 exome data sets collected from familial breast cancer families who were either BRCA1+ or BRCAx. Two novel heterozygous mutations predicted to alter the function of PALB2 were identified (c.2014G>C, p.E672Q and c.2993G>A, p.G998E). Notably, both of these mutations co-existed in BRCA1+ and BRCA1x families. These studies show that mutations in PALB2 can occur independent of the status of BRCA1 mutations, and they highlight the importance to include BRCA1+ families in PALB2 mutation screens."}

We report a patient with autosomal recessive (AR) HSP in whom laboratory investigations revealed hypobetalipoproteinemia raising the possibility of a shared pathophysiology of these clinical features. A lipid profile of his parents disclosed a normal maternal lipid profile. However, the paternal lipid profile was similar to that of the patient suggesting autosomal dominant transmission of this trait. Whole exome sequence analysis was performed and novel mutations were detected in both the SPG11 and the APOB genes. Genetic testing of the parents showed that both APOB variants were inherited from the father while the SPG11 variants were inherited one from each parent. Our results indicate that, in this patient, the hypobetalipoproteinemia and spastic paraplegia are unrelated resulting from mutations in two independent genes. This clinical study provides support for the use of whole exome sequencing as a diagnostic tool for identification of mutations in conditions with complex presentations."}

Two studies showed that co-inheritance of NPHS2-p.Arg229Gln, a podocin variant, may increase the risk for proteinuria and renal function decline.\nWe hypothesized that additional podocin variants may exert a similar effect. We studied genetically a well-characterized Cypriot TBMN patient cohort by re-sequencing the NPHS2 coding region. We also performed functional studies in cell culture experiments, investigating the interaction of podocin variants with itself and with nephrin.\nPotentially disease-modifying podocin variants were searched for by analyzing NPHS2 in 35 'severe' TBMN patients. One non-synonymous variant, p.Glu237Gln, was detected. Both variants, p.Arg229Gln and p.Glu237Gln, were tested in a larger cohort of 122 TBMN patients, who were categorized as 'mild' or 'severe' based on the presence of microscopic hematuria alone or combined with chronic renal failure and/or proteinuria. Seven 'severe' patients carried either of the 2 variants; none was present in the 'mild' patients (p = 0.05, Pearson \u03c7(2)). The 7 carriers belong in 2 families segregating mutation COL4A3-p.Gly1334Glu. Inheritance of the wild-type (WT) and mutant alleles correlated with the phenotype (combined concordance probability 0.003). Immunofluorescence (IF) experiments after dual co-transfection of WT and mutant podocin suggested altered co-localization of mutant homodimers. IF experiments after co-transfection of WT podocin and nephrin showed normal membrane localization, while both podocin variants interfered with normal trafficking, demonstrating perinuclear staining. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed stronger binding of mutant podocin to WT podocin or nephrin.\nThe results support the hypothesis that certain hypomorphic podocin variants may act as adverse genetic modifiers when co-inherited with COL4A3/A4 mutations, thus predisposing to FSGS and severe kidney function decline."}

For families without CDH1 mutations, genetic-based risk stratification has not been possible, resulting in limited clinical options.\nTo derive accurate estimates of gastric and breast cancer risks in CDH1 mutation carriers and determine if germline mutations in other genes are associated with HDGC.\nTesting for CDH1 germline mutations was performed on 183 index cases meeting clinical criteria for HDGC. Penetrance was derived from 75 mutation-positive families from within this and other cohorts, comprising 3858 probands (353 with gastric cancer and 89 with breast cancer). Germline DNA from 144 HDGC probands lacking CDH1 mutations was screened using multiplexed targeted sequencing for 55 cancer-associated genes.\nAccurate estimates of gastric and breast cancer risks in CDH1 mutation carriers and the relative contribution of other cancer predisposition genes in familial gastric cancers.\nThirty-one distinct pathogenic CDH1 mutations (14 novel) were identified in 34 of 183 index cases (19%). By the age of 80 years, the cumulative incidence of gastric cancer was 70% (95% CI, 59%-80%) for males and 56% (95% CI, 44%-69%) for females, and the risk of breast cancer for females was 42% (95% CI, 23%-68%). In CDH1 mutation-negative index cases, candidate mutations were identified in 16 of 144 probands (11%), including mutations within genes of high and moderate penetrance: CTNNA1, BRCA2, STK11, SDHB, PRSS1, ATM, MSR1, and PALB2.\nThis is the largest reported series of CDH1 mutation carriers, providing more precise estimates of age-associated risks of gastric and breast cancer that will improve counseling of unaffected carriers. In HDGC families lacking CDH1 mutations, testing of CTNNA1 and other tumor suppressor genes should be considered. Clinically defined HDGC families can harbor mutations in genes (ie, BRCA2) with different clinical ramifications from CDH1. Therefore, we propose that HDGC syndrome may be best defined by mutations in CDH1 and closely related genes, rather than through clinical criteria that capture families with heterogeneous susceptibility profiles."}

In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of the published data to investigate the impact of the oligoallelic AA mutations of the podocin on proteinuria; a total 16 AA mutations were investigated for oligoallelic pathogenicity. Despite significant heterogeneity within some of the comparisons, the results revealed significantly higher risks of proteinuria in early-onset (onset age <16) individuals for five mutations (P118L, R138Q, R168H, V180M, and V260E), and in all onset ages individuals for five mutations (R138Q, G140X, R229Q, V260E, and V290M) compared to non-variant individuals. We also tested the steroid response in individuals with R229Q and E237Q. No statistically significant differences in the two mutations carrier rate were observed between steroid resistance patients and controls. No AA mutation was selected for meta-analysis on the recurrence of proteinuria after renal transplantation as lack of control data. In conclusion, our meta-analysis tested the pathogenicity of the oligoallelic AA mutations in podocin and suggested the potential causative mutations, and the alleles showing an association with protein susceptibility.

Genetic variation is identified and associated with 30-35% of cases of Brugada Syndrome, with nearly 20-25% attributable to variants in SCN5A, meaning many cases remain undiagnosed genetically. To evaluate the role of genetic variants in arrhythmogenic diseases and the utility of next-generation sequencing, we applied this technology to resequence 28 main genes associated with arrhythmogenic disorders.\nA cohort of 45 clinically diagnosed Brugada Syndrome patients classified as SCN5A-negative was analyzed using next generation sequencing. Twenty-eight genes were resequenced: AKAP9, ANK2, CACNA1C, CACNB2, CASQ2, CAV3, DSC2, DSG2, DSP, GPD1L, HCN4, JUP, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNE3, KCNH2, KCNJ2, KCNJ5, KCNQ1, NOS1AP, PKP2, RYR2, SCN1B, SCN3B, SCN4B, SCN5A, SNTA1, and TMEM43. A total of 85 clinically evaluated relatives were also genetically analyzed to ascertain familial segregation.\nTwenty-two patients carried 30 rare genetic variants in 12 genes, only 4 of which were previously associated with Brugada Syndrome. Neither insertion/deletion nor copy number variation were detected. We identified genetic variants in novel candidate genes potentially associated to Brugada Syndrome. These include: 4 genetic variations in AKAP9 including a de novo genetic variation in 3 positive cases; 5 genetic variations in ANK2 detected in 4 cases; variations in KCNJ2 together with CASQ2 in 1 case; genetic variations in RYR2, including a de novo genetic variation and desmosomal proteins encoding genes including DSG2, DSP and JUP, detected in 3 of the cases. Larger gene panels or whole exome sequencing should be considered to identify novel genes associated to Brugada Syndrome. However, application of approaches such as whole exome sequencing would difficult the interpretation for clinical purposes due to the large amount of data generated. The identification of these genetic variants opens new perspectives on the implications of genetic background in the arrhythmogenic substrate for research purposes.\nAs a paradigm for other arrhythmogenic diseases and for unexplained sudden death, our data show that clinical genetic diagnosis is justified in a family perspective for confirmation of genetic causality. In the era of personalized medicine using high-throughput tools, clinical decision-making is increasingly complex."}

Our goal was to apply a systematic, stringent approach consistent with clinical standards to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with such conditions using a diverse sequencing reference sample. Candidate variants in the 56 ACMG genes were selected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes dataset, which contains sequencing information on 1,092 unrelated individuals from across the world. These variants were filtered using the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional version and defined parameters, appraised through literature review, and examined by a clinical laboratory specialist and expert physician. Over 70,000 genetic variants were extracted from the 56 genes, and filtering identified 237 variants annotated as disease causing by HGMD Professional. Literature review and expert evaluation determined that 7 of these variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Furthermore, 5 additional truncating variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD Professional were identified as likely pathogenic. These 12 secondary findings are associated with diseases that could inform medical follow-up, including cancer predisposition syndromes, cardiac conditions, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The majority of the identified medically actionable findings were in individuals from the European (5/379) and Americas (4/181) ancestry groups, with fewer findings in Asian (2/286) and African (1/246) ancestry groups. Our results suggest that medically relevant secondary findings can be identified in approximately 1% (12/1092) of individuals in a diverse reference sample. As clinical sequencing laboratories continue to implement the ACMG recommendations, our results highlight that at least a small number of potentially important secondary findings can be selected for return. Our results also confirm that understudied populations will not reap proportionate benefits of genomic medicine, highlighting the need for continued research efforts on genetic diseases in these populations."}

We performed descriptive and comparative statistics on the dataset and tested interobserver concordance among the trained scientists. Private variants defined as variants found within single families (n = 5,182), were either VUS (80.5%; n = 4,169) or likely pathogenic (19.5%; n = 1,013).

We recently described that the genetic risk is given by two haplotypes: one covering several strongly linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the promoter of the gene that correlated with low transcript levels, and a second haplotype that includes a rare nonsynonymous variant (Ala71Thr). Here we show that this variant, located within the BLK SH3 domain, is a major determinant of protein levels. In vitro analyses show that the 71Thr isoform is hyperphosphorylated and promotes kinase activation. As a consequence, BLK is ubiquitinated, its proteasomal degradation enhanced and the average life of the protein is reduced by half. Altogether, these findings suggest that an intrinsic autoregulatory mechanism previously unappreciated in BLK is disrupted by the 71Thr substitution. Because the SH3 domain is also involved in protein interactions, we sought for differences between the two isoforms in trafficking and binding to protein partners. We found that binding of the 71Thr variant to the adaptor protein BANK1 is severely reduced. Our study provides new insights on the intrinsic regulation of BLK activation and highlights the dominant role of its SH3 domain in BANK1 binding."}

The purpose of this study was to investigate functional cellular defects present in adult cardiac myocytes expressing mutant \u03b4-sarcoglycans harboring the dominant inherited DCM mutations R71T or R97Q. This study demonstrates that DCM mutant \u03b4-sarcoglycans can be stably expressed in adult rat cardiac myocytes and traffic similarly to wild-type \u03b4-sarcoglycan to the plasma membrane, without perturbing assembly of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. However, expression of DCM mutant \u03b4-sarcoglycan in adult rat cardiac myocytes is sufficient to alter cardiac myocyte plasma membrane stability in the presence of mechanical strain. Upon cyclical cell stretching, cardiac myocytes expressing mutant \u03b4-sarcoglycan R97Q or R71T have increased cell-impermeant dye uptake and undergo contractures at greater frequencies than myocytes expressing normal \u03b4-sarcoglycan. Additionally, the R71T mutation creates an ectopic N-linked glycosylation site that results in aberrant glycosylation of the extracellular domain of \u03b4-sarcoglycan. Therefore, appropriate glycosylation of \u03b4-sarcoglycan may also be necessary for proper \u03b4-sarcoglycan function and overall dystrophin-glycoprotein complex function.

We compiled the clinical features of reported cases and reviewed available literature for cases with features suggestive of CRB2-related syndrome in order to better understand the phenotypic and genotypic manifestations. Phenotypic analyses showed that ventriculomegaly was a common clinical manifestation (9/11 confirmed cases), in contrast to the original reports, in which patients were ascertained due to renal disease.

Further genetic analysis identified one family with two affected siblings who were both heterozygous for a variant in NPHS2 predicted to affect function and separate families with sequence variants in NPHS4 and BBS7 in addition to the CRB2 variants.

Finally, we apply a rare-disease inheritance model to identify variation in genes previously associated with CHD (ZFPM2, NSD1, NOTCH1, VCAN, and MYH6), cardiac malformations in mouse models (ADAM17, CHRD, IFT140, PTPRJ, RYR1 and ATE1), and hypomorphic alleles of genes causing syndromic CHD (EHMT1, SRCAP, BBS2, NOTCH2, and KMT2D) in 14 of 59 trios, greatly exceeding variation in control trios without CHD (p = 9.60e-06). In total, 32% of trios carried at least one putatively disease-associated variant across 19 loci,suggesting that inherited and de novo variation across a heterogeneous group of loci may contribute to disease risk."}

Those affected of primary HTG were considered for further genetic analysis. The promoters, coding regions and exon-intron boundaries of LPL, LMF1, APOC2, APOA5, APOE and GPIHBP1 genes were sequenced. The frequency of rare variants identified was studied in 90 controls.\nOne hundred ninety-four subjects (1.04%) had HTG and 90 subjects (46.4%) met the inclusion criteria for primary HTG. In this subgroup, nine patients (12.3%) were carriers of 7 rare variants in LPL, LMF1, APOA5, GPIHBP1 or APOE genes. Three of these mutations are described for the first time in this work. The presence of a rare pathogenic mutation did not confer a differential phenotype or a higher family history of HTG.\nThe prevalence of rare mutations in candidate genes in subjects with primary HTG is low. The low frequency of rare mutations, the absence of a more severe phenotype or the dominant transmission of the HTG would not suggest the use of genetic analysis in the clinical practice in this population."}

LP or P mutations were identified in 12 of 25 breast cancer susceptibility genes in 26 families without identified BRCA1/2 mutations (11%). Evaluation of 84 additional genes associated with autosomal-dominant cancer susceptibility identified LP or P mutations in only two additional families (0.8%). However, individuals from 10 of 253 families (3.9%) had incidental LP or P mutations in 32 non-cancer-associated genes, and 9% of individuals were monoallelic carriers of a rare LP or P mutation in 39 genes associated with autosomal-recessive cancer susceptibility. Furthermore, 95% of individuals had at least one VUS. In summary, these data support the clinical utility of ACMG variant-classification guidelines.

We show that this assay identifies elements with endogenous erythroid regulatory activity. Across 23 sentinel variants, we conservatively identified 32 MPRA functional variants (MFVs). We used targeted genome editing to demonstrate endogenous enhancer activity across 3 MFVs that predominantly affect the transcription of SMIM1, RBM38, and CD164.

All the coding exons and intron/exon boundaries of PALB2 were subjected to mutational analysis by heteroduplex analysis (HDA)and DNA sequencing. Eighteen PALB2 variants were found in breast cancer patients within the Turkish population. Three variants (c.271G>A, c.404C>A and c.2981T>A) have not been previously reported. In addition, nine intronic variants were described, and this study is the first to describe the c.1685-44T>A intronic variant. The prevalence of possible pathogenic PALB2 variants was found to be 4.03\u00a0% in BRCA1/2-negative Turkish patients with early-onset breast cancer.

Three Han Chinese adult patients with clinical phenotype suggestive of NLRP12-AD carrying NLRP12 variants were treated by the authors in 2015. Their phenotype and genotype were carefully studied. A PubMed search for SAIDs was conducted between January, 1990 and January, 2016, and we focused on NLRP12-AD. All three adult patients developed periodic disease in adulthood.

Here, we report 83 height-associated coding variants with lower minor-allele frequencies (in the range of 0.1-4.8%) and effects of up to 2\u2009centimetres per allele (such as those in IHH, STC2, AR and CRISPLD2), greater than ten times the average effect of common variants. In functional follow-up studies, rare height-increasing alleles of STC2 (giving an increase of 1-2\u2009centimetres per allele) compromised proteolytic inhibition of PAPP-A and increased cleavage of IGFBP-4 in vitro, resulting in higher bioavailability of insulin-like growth factors. These 83 height-associated variants overlap genes that are mutated in monogenic growth disorders and highlight new biological candidates (such as ADAMTS3, IL11RA and NOX4) and pathways (such as proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan synthesis) involved in growth. Our results demonstrate that sufficiently large sample sizes can uncover rare and low-frequency variants of moderate-to-large effect associated with polygenic human phenotypes, and that these variants implicate relevant genes and pathways."}

The genetic basis of this condition remains unknown. In a cohort study of nine individuals suspected to have Moebius syndrome (six typical, three atypical), we performed whole-exome sequencing to try to identify a commonly mutated gene. Although no such gene was identified and we did not find mutations in PLXND1 and REV3L, we found a de novo heterozygous mutation, p.E410K, in the gene encoding tubulin beta 3 class III (TUBB3), in an individual with atypical Moebius syndrome. This individual was diagnosed with near-complete ophthalmoplegia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and absence of the septum pellucidum. No substantial limb abnormalities were noted. Mutations in TUBB3 have been associated with complex cortical dysplasia and other brain malformations and congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles type 3A (CFEOM3A).

Method: The clinical data of 3 cases with FMF misdiagnosed as Juvenile idiopathic arthritis(JIA)seen from January 2014 to June 2016 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively collected. The clinical manifestations, gene mutation characteristics, treatment and prognosis were also evaluated. Result: Two cases were male and 1 was female. The mean age of onset was 17 months (3 months to 36 months), while the average age of diagnosis was 6 years and 8 months (24 months to 11 years). All the 3 cases presented with periodic fever, red rash and arthritis.Two of them suffered from anemia, 2 of them showed lymphadenopathy, and 1 of them presented with hepatosplenomegaly. All of the 3 cases were diagnosed as JIA by excluding infectious diseases and neoplastic diseases and respondiug poorly to anti-infection treatment, but they benefitted little from glucocorticoids and a variety of immunosuppressive therapy. The mutations of MEFV gene were found in 3 cases by gene detection, and all of them were complex heterozygous mutations. Four reported pathogenic mutations were found: R202Q, E148Q, L110P, P369S.

Presumably pathogenic variants based on frequency and database annotations or generic characteristics and mutation type were selected in genes shared by the couple and in the female's X-chromosome. Unclassified variants were not included.\nThis yielded an average of 29 (19-51) variants in genes shared by the consanguineous couples and 15 (6-30) shared by the nonconsanguineous couples. For X-linked variants, the numbers per female were 3 (1-5) and 1 (0-3), respectively. Remaining variants were verified manually. The majority were able to be quickly discarded, effectively leaving true pathogenic variants.\nWe conclude that WES is applicable for PCS, both for consanguineous and nonconsanguineous couples, with the remaining number of variants being manageable in a clinical setting. The addition of gene panels for filtering was not favorable because it resulted in missing pathogenic variants.

In practice, however, several aspects of the guidelines lack specificity, are subject to varied interpretations, or fail to capture relevant aspects of clinical molecular genetics. A simple implementation of the guidelines in their current form is insufficient for consistent and comprehensive variant classification.MethodsWe undertook an iterative process of refining the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We used the guidelines to classify more than 40,000 clinically observed variants, assessed the outcome, and refined the classification criteria to capture exceptions and edge cases. During this process, the criteria evolved through eight major and minor revisions.ResultsOur implementation: (i) separated ambiguous ACMG-AMP criteria into a set of discrete but related rules with refined weights; (ii) grouped certain criteria to protect against the overcounting of conceptually related evidence; and (iii) replaced the \"clinical criteria\" style of the guidelines with additive, semiquantitative criteria.ConclusionSherloc builds on the strong framework of 33 rules established by the ACMG-AMP guidelines and introduces 108 detailed refinements, which support a more consistent and transparent approach to variant classification."}

However, despite high-throughput sequencing studies, the cause of the disease remains unknown in most patients, and several studies support more complex inheritance and the role of environmental factors and/or epigenetics in the pathophysiology of CAKUT. Here, we report the targeted exome sequencing of 330 genes, including genes known to be involved in CAKUT and candidate genes, in a cohort of 204 unrelated patients with CAKUT; 45% of the patients were severe fetal cases. We identified pathogenic mutations in 36 of 204 (17.6%) patients. These mutations included five de novo heterozygous loss of function mutations/deletions in the PBX homeobox 1 gene (PBX1), a gene known to have a crucial role in kidney development. In contrast, the frequency of SOX17 and DSTYK variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT did not indicate causality. These findings suggest that PBX1 is involved in monogenic CAKUT in humans and call into question the role of some gene variants recently reported as pathogenic in CAKUT. Targeted exome sequencing also proved to be an efficient and cost-effective strategy to identify pathogenic mutations and deletions in known CAKUT genes."}

They are a common finding in sequencing-based genetic tests and pose a significant clinical challenge. The objective of this study was to assess the use of functional data to classify variants according to pathogenicity. We conduct functional analysis of a large set of BRCA1 VUS combining a validated functional assay with VarCall, a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the likelihood of pathogenicity given the functional data. The results from the functional assays were incorporated into a joint analysis of 214 BRCA1 VUS to predict their likelihood of pathogenicity (breast cancer). We show that applying the VarCall model (1.0 sensitivity; lower bound of 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75 and 1.0 specificity; lower bound of 95% CI = 0.83) to the current set of BRCA1 variants, use of the functional data would significantly reduce the number of VUS associated with the C-terminal region of the BRCA1 protein by ~ 87%. We extend this work developing yeast-based functional assays for two other genes coding for BRCT domain containing proteins, MCPH1 and MDC1. Analysis of missense variants in MCPH1 and MDC1 shows that structural inference based on the BRCA1 data set can aid in prioritising variants for further analysis. Taken together our results indicate that systematic functional assays can provide a robust tool to aid in clinical annotation of VUS. We propose that well-validated functional assays could be used for clinical annotation even in the absence of additional sources of evidence."}

Our pipeline identified 14 new alternative splices in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in addition to detecting the majority of known alternative spliced transcripts therein. We provide here the first global splicing pattern analysis for the other nine genes, which will enable a comprehensive interpretation of splicing defects caused by VUS in HBOC. Previously known splicing alterations were consistently detected, occasionally with a more complex splicing pattern than expected. We also found that splicing in the 11 genes is similar in blood and breast tissue, supporting the utility and simplicity of blood splicing assays. Our pipeline is ready to be integrated into standard molecular diagnosis for HBOC, but it could equally be adapted for an integrative analysis of any multigene disorder."}

BRCA2 was mapped to chromosomal 13q at about the same time (4). Just fifteen months later, Wooster et al.

Conformation-sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) analysis of PCR-amplified DNA followed by direct sequencing was used to detect sequence variants. Three of eleven individuals carry the same mutation, all are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, supporting the observation by Neuhausen et al. in this issue that there is a common mutation in this population. Eleven truncating mutations and nine polymorphisms were identified -- all were coding region variants. No loss-of-transcript mutations were identified in the sixteen samples for which this analysis was possible. Seven of the nine disease-associated mutations were detected in the 50 men with breast cancers; for thus in our series, BRCA2 mutations account for 14% of male breast cancer, all but one of which had a family history of male and/or female breast cancer."}

He also had severe clinical problems after Bacille Calmette-Ge\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination and following Epstein-Barr virus and Varicella Zoster virus infections. His peripheral blood lymphocytes contained a normal percentage and absolute number of CD3-CD7+ cells, which were positively stained with the CD16 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) 3G8 and CLBFcRgran1, but did marginally stain with the CD16 MoAb Lau11c/B73.1. Fc gamma RillIb expression on granulocytes appeared to be normal. NK cell function, analyzed in vitro by direct cytotoxicity on K562 target cells and ADCC-activity on P815 target cells, was normal compared with an age-matched healthy control. Sequence analysis of the Fc gamma RIIIA gene, encoding CD16 on NK cells and macrophages, showed a T to A nucleotide substitution at position 230 on both alleles, predicting a leucine (L) to histidine (H) amino acid change position 48 in the first extracellular lg-like domain of Fc gamma RIIIa, which contains the Leu11c/B73.1 epitope. The combined use of CD16 and CD56 MoAbs labeled with the same fluorescent dye, as often applied in routine immunophenotyping procedures, will leave these homozygotes undiagnosed. The pattern of infections in this patient is in agreement with the postulated function of NK cells in the immunological defense against viruses and other intracellular microorganisms. Further analysis of the NK cell function in vitro and follow-up of the clinical course of Fc gamma RIIIA-48H/H homozygotes is required to ascertain whether this genotype is causally related to an NK cell immunodeficiency."}

Genet.: 60(2), 366-72.", "abstract": "Human orythrocytes that are homozygous for the Duarte enzyme variant of galactosemia (D/D) have a characteristic isoform on isoelectric focusing and 50% reduction in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) enzyme activity. The Duarte biochemical phenotype has a molecular genotype of N314D/N314D. The characteristic Duarte isoform is also associated with a variant called the \"Los Angeles (LA) phenotype,\" which has increased GALT enzyme activity. We evaluated GALT enzyme activity and screened the GALT genes of 145 patients with one or more N314D-containing alleles. We found seven with the LA biochemical phenotype, and all had a 1721C-->T transition in exon 7 in cis with the N314D missense mutation. The 1721C-->T transition is a neutral polymorphism for leucine at amino acid 218 (L218L). In pedigree analyses, this 1721C-->T transition segregated with the LA phenotype of increased GALT activity in three different biochemical phenotypes (LA/N, LA/G, and LA/D). To determine the mechanism for increased activity of the LA variant, we compared GALT mRNA, protein abundance, and enzyme thermal stability in lymphoblast cell lines of D and LA phenotypes with comparable genotypes. GALT protein abundance was increased in LA compared to D alleles, but mRNA was similar among all genotypes. When LA/D and D/D GALT biochemical phenotypes were compared to N/N GALT phenotypes, both had 50%, as compared to 21%, reduction in GALT activity in the wild type (N/N) after exposure at identical initial enzyme activity to 50 degrees C for 15 min. We conclude that the codon change N314D in cis with the base-pair transition 1721C-->T produces the LA variant of galactosemia and that this nucleotide change increases GALT activity by increasing GALT protein abundance without increasing transcription or decreasing thermal lability. A favorable codon bias for the mutated codon with consequently increased translation rates is postulated as the mechanism."}

The cumulative risk of breast cancer in female gene carriers was estimated to be 59.8% by age 50 years (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 25.9%-78.5%) and 79.5% by age 70 years (95% CI 28.9%-97.5%). The cumulative risk of breast cancer in male carriers was estimated to be 6.3% (95% CI 1.4%-25.6%) by age 70 years. There was no evidence of any risk difference between the two families. These results indicate that the lifetime breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers, for at least a subset of mutations, is comparable to that for BRCA1. A significant excess of ovarian cancer in gene carriers was observed (relative risk 17.69, based on three cases), but the absolute risk of ovarian cancer was less than that reported for BRCA1. Significant excesses of laryngeal cancer (relative risk 7.67, based on two possible carriers) and prostate cancer (relative risk 2.89, based on five possible carriers) were also observed. One case of ocular melanoma, as well as a second eye cancer of unspecified histology, occurred in obligate gene carriers."}

However, knowledge regarding all possible mutations and the relationship between risk factors and mutations is incomplete.\nTo identify BRCA1 mutations and to determine factors that best predict presence of a deleterious BRCA1 mutation in patients with breast and/or ovarian cancer.\nA complete sequence analysis of the BRCA1 coding sequence and flanking intronic regions was performed in 798 women in a collaborative effort involving institutions from the United States, Italy, Germany, Finland, and Switzerland.\nInstitutions selected 798 persons representing families (1 person for each family) thought to be at elevated a priori risk of BRCA1 mutation due to potential risk factors, such as multiple cases of breast cancer, early age of breast cancer diagnosis, and cases of ovarian cancer. No participant was from a family in which genetic markers showed linkage to the BRCA1 locus.\nSequence variants detected in this sample are presented along with analyses designed to determine predictive characteristics of those testing positive for BRCA1 mutations.\nIn 102 women (12.8%), clearly deleterious mutations were detected. Fifty new genetic alterations were found including 24 deleterious mutations, 24 variants of unknown significance, and 2 rare polymorphisms. In a subset of 71 Ashkenazi Jewish women, only 2 distinct deleterious mutations were found: 185delAG in 17 cases and 5382insC in 7 cases. A bias in prior reports for mutations in exon 11 was revealed. Characteristics of a patient's specific diagnosis (unilateral or bilateral breast cancer, with or without ovarian cancer), early age at diagnosis, Ashkenazi Jewish ethnicity, and family history of cancer were positively associated with the probability of her carrying a deleterious BRCA1 mutation.\nUsing logistic regression analysis, we provide a method for evaluating the probability of a woman's carrying a deleterious BRCA1 mutation for a wide range of cases, which can be an important tool for clinicians as they incorporate genetic susceptibility testing into their medical practice."}

About half of all patients diagnosed with CBS deficiency respond to pyridoxine treatment with a significant lowering of tHcy levels. We examined 12 CBS-deficient patients from 10 Norwegian families for mutations in the CBS gene and identified mutations in 18 of the 20 CBS alleles. Five of the seven patients classified as pyridoxine-responsive contain the newly identified point mutation, G797A (R266K). This point mutation is tightly linked with a previously identified 'benign' 68 bp duplication of the intron 7-exon 8 boundary within the CBS gene. We tested the effect of all of the mutations identified on human CBS function utilizing a yeast system. Five of the six mutations had a distinguishable phenotype in yeast, indicating that they were in fact pathogenic. Interestingly, the G797A allele had no phenotype when the yeast were grown in high concentrations of pyridoxine, but a severe phenotype when grown in low concentrations, thus mirroring the behavior in humans. These studies show that the G797A mutation is an important cause of pyridoxine-responsive CBS deficiency and demonstrate the utility of yeast functional assays in the analysis of human mutations."}

The polymorphic (Tg)m locus explains the partial penetrance of the T5 polymorphism as a disease mutation.", "year": "1998", "journal": "J. Clin. Invest.: 101(2), 487-96.", "abstract": "In congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens patients, the T5 allele at the polymorphic Tn locus in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene is a frequent disease mutation with incomplete penetrance. This T5 allele will result in a high proportion of CFTR transcripts that lack exon 9, whose translation products will not contribute to apical chloride channel activity. Besides the polymorphic Tn locus, more than 120 polymorphisms have been described in the CFTR gene. We hypothesized that the combination of particular alleles at several polymorphic loci might result in less functional or even insufficient CFTR protein. Analysis of three polymorphic loci with frequent alleles in the general population showed that, in addition to the known effect of the Tn locus, the quantity and quality of CFTR transcripts and/or proteins was affected by two other polymorphic loci: (TG)m and M470V. On a T7 background, the (TG)11 allele gave a 2.8-fold increase in the proportion of CFTR transcripts that lacked exon 9, and (TG)12 gave a sixfold increase, compared with the (TG)10 allele. T5 CFTR genes derived from patients were found to carry a high number of TG repeats, while T5 CFTR genes derived from healthy CF fathers harbored a low number of TG repeats. Moreover, it was found that M470 CFTR proteins matured more slowly, and that they had a 1.7-fold increased intrinsic chloride channel activity compared with V470 CFTR proteins, suggesting that the M470V locus might also play a role in the partial penetrance of T5 as a disease mutation. Such polyvariant mutant genes could explain why apparently normal CFTR genes cause disease. Moreover, they might be responsible for variation in the phenotypic expression of CFTR mutations, and be of relevance in other genetic diseases."}

We have used a combination of SSCP, heteroduplex analysis, and chemical cleavage of mismatch to screen the BRCA1 gene for mutations in the germline of 42 patients with breast or ovarian cancer who either have a moderate family history of these cancers, or have no family history of malignancy but a very early onset of the disease. A total of 30 sequence variants were observed, eight of which have not been described previously. Three sequence changes detected by chemical cleavage or heteroduplex analysis were missed by SSCP. The variants included 13 missense mutations, which were assessed for their pathogenic implications. Two of these (M18T and A1708E) are nonconservative substitutions which are located in evolutionarily conserved regions of the gene: M18T lies just upstream of the RING finger motif, and A1708E abolishes the transcriptional transactivation activity of the carboxy-terminal region of BRCA1. Mutations were observed in eight patients overall (19.0%), and protein-truncating mutations occurred in five of 27 (18.5%) families with 1-3 cases of breast or ovarian cancer. The data suggest that a significant proportion of patients with a modest or no family history of these cancers may carry germline mutations in BRCA1."}

Mol. Genet.: 8(3), 413-23.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of simple sequence variation in the BRCA2 gene. To this end, 71 breast and breast-ovarian cancer (HBC/HBOC) families along with 95 control individuals from a wide range of ethnicities were analyzed by means of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and direct sequence analysis. In the coding (10 257 bp) and non-coding (2799 bp) sequences of BRCA2, 82 sequence variants were identified. Three different, apparently disease-associated BRCA2 mutations were found in six HBC/HBOC families (8%): two splice site mutations in introns 5 and 21, and one frameshift mutation in exon 11. In the coding region, 53 simple sequence variants were found: 35 missense mutations, one 2 bp deletion (CT) resulting in a stop at codon 3364, one nonsense mutation with a stop at codon 3326, one deletion of a complete codon (AAA) resulting in the loss of leucine, and 15 silent mutations. In the non-coding region, 26 polymorphisms were detected. Of the 79 sequence variants that were not obviously disease-associated, eight were detected only in HBC/HBOC families. The remaining 71 variants were identified in both HBC/HBOC families and control individuals. Sixty three sequence variants (80%) were specific for a continent. Forty two percent (33 out of 79) of the sequence variants were detected exclusively in Africa, though only 13% of the 332 chromosomes screened were of African origin. Our data indicate that, in BRCA2, simple sequence variation is frequent [in the coding region 1 in 194 bp (straight theta = 2.2 x 10(-4)), and in the non-coding region 1 in 108 bp (straight theta = 4.4 x 10(-4)), respectively]."}
