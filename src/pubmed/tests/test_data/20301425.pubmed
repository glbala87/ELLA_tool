AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated hereditary breast and 
      ovarian cancer (HBOC) is characterized by an increased risk for female and male 
      breast cancer, ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal 
      cancers), and to a lesser extent other cancers such as prostate cancer, 
      pancreatic cancer, and melanoma primarily in individuals with a BRCA2 pathogenic 
      variant. The risk of developing an associated cancer varies depending on whether 
      HBOC is caused by a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The 
      diagnosis of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated HBOC is established in a proband by 
      identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 on 
      molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment of 
      breast cancer per oncologist with consideration of bilateral mastectomy as a 
      primary surgical treatment of breast cancer because of elevated rate of 
      ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer; PARP inhibitors may be considered in 
      BRCA1- and BRCA2-related tumors. Melanoma treatment per dermatologist and 
      oncologist. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylactic bilateral 
      mastectomy, prophylactic oophorectomy, and chemoprevention (e.g., tamoxifen) have 
      been used for breast cancer prevention, but have not been assessed by randomized 
      trials in high-risk women. Prophylactic salpingectomy followed by delayed 
      oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer prevention. 
      Surveillance: Breast cancer screening in women relies on a combination of monthly 
      breast self-examination, annual or semiannual clinical breast examination, annual 
      mammography, and breast MRI. Annual transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 
      concentration beginning at age 35 years may be considered for ovarian cancer 
      screening. However, this screening has not been effective in detecting 
      early-stage ovarian cancer, either in high-risk or average-risk women. For men, 
      breast cancer screening includes breast self-examination education and training 
      and annual clinical breast examination beginning at age 35. Annual serum 
      prostate-specific antigen and digital rectal exam screening should begin at age 
      45. Screening for melanoma should be individualized based on the family history. 
      Screening of asymptomatic individuals for pancreatic cancer is not generally 
      recommended. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Once a cancer-predisposing BRCA1 or 
      BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant has been identified in a family, testing of 
      at-risk relatives can identify those family members who also have the familial 
      pathogenic variant and thus need increased surveillance and specific treatments 
      when a cancer is identified. GENETIC COUNSELING: BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated HBOC 
      is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The vast majority of individuals 
      with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant have inherited it from a parent. 
      However, because the penetrance of breast, ovarian, and other cancers associated 
      with pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is less than 100%, not all 
      individuals with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variant have a parent affected with 
      cancer. The offspring of an individual with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline pathogenic 
      variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once a 
      cancer-predisposing BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline variant has been identified in a 
      family, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.
