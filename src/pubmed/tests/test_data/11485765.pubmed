TI  - Peripherin/RDS gene mutation (Pro210Leu) and polymorphisms in Japanese patients 
      with retinal dystrophies.
PG  - 355-8
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the frequency of peripherin/RDS (retinal degeneration slow) 
      gene mutations in Japanese patients with retinal dystrophies. METHODS: We 
      analyzed the peripherin/RDS gene in 54 unrelated Japanese patients with retinal 
      dystrophies. Genomic DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the 
      PCR products were sequenced. We also examined 100 healthy subjects, seeking 
      mutations or variations of the peripherin/RDS gene. RESULTS: Of the 54 Japanese 
      patients, one with retinitis pigmentosa had a heterozygous C to T change at the 
      second nucleotide at codon 210 of exon 2 (CCT to CTT/Pro210Leu) of the 
      peripherin/RDS gene. None of the 100 individuals with normal fundi had the 
      Pro210Leu mutation of the peripherin/RDS gene. Three variants of the 
      peripherin/RDS gene (GTC to GTT/Val106Val, Glu304Gln, and Gly338Asp) were also 
      found. The first variation (GTC to GTT/Val106Val) was silent. Two concurrent 
      missense variations (Glu304Gln and Gly338Asp) were seen in 25.9% of the affected 
      patients and in 29% of the healthy individuals. CONCLUSION: A novel mutation 
      (Pro210Leu) of the peripherin/RDS gene has been found in one Japanese patient 
      with retinitis pigmentosa. The alterations of Val106Val, Glu304Gln, and Gly338Asp 
      may be polymorphic variants in the Japanese population.
