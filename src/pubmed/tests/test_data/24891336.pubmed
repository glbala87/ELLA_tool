AB  - OBJECTIVE: Autoinflammatory disorders are caused by a primary dysfunction of the 
      innate immune system. Among these disorders are hereditary recurrent fevers, 
      which are characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammatory 
      manifestations affecting multiple tissues. Hereditary recurrent fevers often lack 
      objective diagnostic criteria, thereby hampering the identification of 
      disease-causing genes. This study was undertaken to identify a gene responsible 
      for hereditary recurrent fevers. METHODS: Copy number variations and point 
      mutations were sought by array-comparative genomic hybridization and polymerase 
      chain reaction sequencing, respectively. Serum cytokine levels were measured 
      using Luminex technology. The effect of TNFRSF11A molecular defects on NF-κB 
      signaling in cells expressing wild-type and mutated forms of the receptor was 
      evaluated by luciferase assay. RESULTS: A patient with multiple congenital 
      anomalies and hereditary recurrent fever was found to carry a de novo 
      heterozygous complex chromosomal rearrangement encompassing a duplication of 
      TNFRSF11A, a gene known to regulate fever in rodents. We also identified a 
      heterozygous frameshift mutation (p.Met416Cysfs*110) in TNFRSF11A in a mother and 
      daughter with isolated hereditary recurrent fever. This mutation was associated 
      with increased secretion of several inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor 
      α [TNFα], interleukin-18 [IL-18], IL-1 receptor antagonist, interferon-γ) and 
      altered the biologic effects of the receptor on NF-κB signaling. The disease in 
      the patients described herein exhibits striking clinical similarities to TNF 
      receptor-associated periodic syndrome, another hereditary recurrent fever 
      involving a gene of the same family (TNFRSF1A). CONCLUSION: The involvement of 
      TNFRSF11A in hereditary recurrent fever highlights the key role of this receptor 
      in innate immunity. The present results also suggest that TNFRSF11A screening 
      could serve as a new diagnostic test for autoinflammatory disorders.
