BTI - Risk Assessment, Genetic Counseling, and Genetic Testing for BRCA-Related Cancer: 
      Systematic Review to Update the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
      Recommendation
AB  - PURPOSE: To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, 
      genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women for the 
      U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and PsycINFO (January 
      2002 to December 31, 2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and 
      Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (4th Quarter 2012), Scopus, and reference 
      lists were searched for English-language studies of benefits and harms of risk 
      assessment, genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce 
      BRCA-related cancer and mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirteen general risk models, 
      such as the Gail model, are modest predictors of individual risk for breast 
      cancer (c-statistic, 0.55 to 0.65). Five familial risk models for nongenetics 
      specialists to guide referrals to genetic counseling accurately predict 
      individual risk for BRCA mutations (c-statistic, &gt;0.80). No studies reported 
      harms of risk assessment. Sixteen studies indicated that genetic counseling 
      decreases cancer worry, anxiety, and depression; increases the accuracy of risk 
      perception; and decreases intention for mutation testing. Thirty-two new studies 
      and 38 earlier studies provided data for meta-analysis estimates of the 
      prevalence and penetrance of BRCA mutations. Prevalence varies by population: 0.2 
      to 0.3 percent in general populations, 3 percent in women with breast cancer, 6 
      percent in women with breast cancer onset before age 40 years, 10 percent in 
      women with ovarian cancer, and 20 percent in high-risk families. Among Ashkenazi 
      Jewish women, prevalence is 2 percent in unselected populations and 10 percent in 
      high-risk families. The penetrance of BRCA mutations differs by test result. 
      Breast cancer penetrance to age 70 years if the test is positive is 46 to 71 
      percent for BRCA1 or BRCA2; ovarian cancer penetrance is 41 to 46 percent for 
      BRCA1 and 17 to 23 percent for BRCA2. No estimates were available for women with 
      variants of uncertain significance. The standardized incidence rate for breast 
      cancer is 3.81 (95% CI, 3.06 to 4.75) for uninformative negative test results and 
      1.13 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.58) for true negative results. Estimates for ovarian 
      cancer were highly heterogeneous. Breast cancer worry and anxiety increased after 
      testing in women with positive results and decreased in others, although results 
      differed across studies. Risk perception improved after receiving test results. 
      No trials of the effectiveness of intensive screening for breast or ovarian 
      cancer in women who are mutation carriers have been published. False-positive 
      rates, unnecessary imaging, and unneeded surgery were higher in women undergoing 
      intensive screening. Most women experienced no anxiety after screening with 
      magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, or clinical breast examination, although 
      women recalled for additional testing had transient anxiety. There are no trials 
      of risk-reducing medications specifically in women who are mutation carriers. 
      Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduced invasive breast cancer by 30 to 68 percent in 
      placebo-controlled trials enrolling women with various levels of risk; tamoxifen 
      had a greater effect than raloxifene in a head-to-head trial. Results suggested 
      that reduction was greater in women with more relatives with breast cancer, but 
      confidence intervals overlapped and results were not specific for women who are 
      mutation carriers. Tamoxifen and raloxifene increased thromboembolic events and 
      tamoxifen increased endometrial cancer and cataracts. In high-risk women and 
      women who are mutation carriers, risk-reducing mastectomy reduced breast cancer 
      by 85 to 100 percent and breast cancer mortality by 81 to 100 percent; 
      risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduced breast cancer by 37 to 100 percent, 
      ovarian cancer by 69 to 100 percent, and all-cause mortality by 55 to 100 
      percent. Some women experienced physical complications of surgery, postsurgical 
      symptoms, or changes in body image; some had improved anxiety. LIMITATIONS: 
      Including only English-language articles and studies applicable to the United 
      States; varying number, quality, and applicability of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Risk 
      assessment using familial risk models to guide referrals is accurate. Genetic 
      counseling reduces distress, improves risk perception, and reduces intention for 
      testing. Genetic testing provides risk estimates for specific populations 
      depending on test results. A true negative test indicates no increased risk for 
      breast cancer. The effectiveness of intensive screening is not known, but it 
      increases false-positive results and procedures. Tamoxifen and raloxifene reduce 
      risk for breast cancer, but have adverse effects. Risk-reducing mastectomy and 
      salpingo-oophorectomy are effective in reducing breast and ovarian cancer. 
      Several evidence gaps remain and additional studies are necessary to better 
      inform practice.
