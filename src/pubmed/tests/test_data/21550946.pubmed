AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), 
      which allows the selection of embryos without mutations for implantation, with 
      specific application for mutations in GNAS. METHODS: We identified a GNAS 
      mutation in a patient with a severe form of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy 
      and pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1a with phocomelia and performed PGD on embryos 
      derived by in vitro fertilization in order to deliver an unaffected infant. 
      RESULTS: After in vitro fertilization, embryos that were homozygous normal for 
      GNAS were identified and implanted into the mother. Ultrasonography 34 days after 
      embryo transfer showed a viable singleton intrauterine pregnancy. A 
      normal-appearing male infant was born at 36.5 weeks of gestation. Newborn 
      screening revealed normal results of thyroid function tests, and a buccal swab 
      obtained when the child was 1 year old verified normal GNAS gene sequences. 
      CONCLUSION: PGD is an alternative that can be offered for many genetic diseases 
      and represents a method to decrease and potentially eliminate the transmission of 
      severe genetic diseases. Patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 
      with known RET gene mutations as well as those with other heritable disorders are 
      candidates for PGD. Successful PGD in patients with MEN has not yet been reported 
      and has met with some early difficulties, but it is believed that this technique 
      will eventually be successful for MEN and other hereditary endocrine disorders.
