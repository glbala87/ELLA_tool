AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is an autosomal dominant 
      disease that causes arterial spurting, intestinal perforation, uterine rupture 
      and hemopneumothorax due to decreased production of type III collagen. The 
      average age at death is 48 years old, and it is considered to be the most severe 
      form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. We report the case of a 64-year-old Japanese 
      woman and her 38-year-old daughter who were diagnosed with this disease. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital because 
      of right anterior chest pain following cough and pharyngeal discomfort. Pleurisy 
      was suspected due to the presence of right pleural effusion, so the next day she 
      was referred to our department, where a detailed examination led to the diagnosis 
      of hemothorax. The bleeding that caused the right hemothorax was difficult to 
      control, so our patient was transferred to the Department of Thoracic Surgery for 
      hemostasis control. Our patient&#x27;s personal history of uterine hemorrhage and skin 
      ulcers, as well as the finding of skin fragility during surgery, were indicative 
      of a weak connective tissue disease; therefore, after improvement of the 
      hemothorax, a genetic analysis was performed. This revealed a heterozygous 
      missense mutation in COL3A1, c.2411 G&gt;T p.Gly804Val (exon 36). A detailed 
      investigation conducted at a later date revealed that her daughter also had the 
      same genetic mutation. This led to the diagnosis of vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos 
      syndrome characterized by a new gene mutation. CONCLUSION: We report a new 
      genetic mutation associated with vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. We present 
      the clinical and imaging findings, and the disease and treatment course in this 
      patient. We believe this information will be important in treating future cases 
      of vascular-type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in patients with this mutation.
